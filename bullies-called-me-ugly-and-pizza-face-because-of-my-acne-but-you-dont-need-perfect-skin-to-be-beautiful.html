But influencer </strong>Kadeeja Khan is proof that you don’t need perfect skin to be beautiful.</p><p>Here, Fabulous Beauty Panel member Kadeeja, 24, reveals how she learned to love her skin, spots and all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CREDIT-Photographer-Thea-Baddiley-.jpg><p>MANY people think acne is a phase, or a rite of passage you go through in puberty, but at this point, I’ve lived with acne more than I’ve lived without it.</p><p>I got my first spot at 11, and it quickly multiplied. After a visit to the GP for advice on how to deal with them, came the official diagnosis: I had acne.</p><p>I’d just started secondary school and was already anxious, but now there were a whole host of other questions on my mind.</p><p>What’s acne? How can I get rid of it? What’s wrong with me? Why can’t my skin be normal? Why can’t I just be like all the other girls at school?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Instagram_emeraldxbeauty-.jpg><p>I spent hours daydreaming of what my life would look like with perfect skin, but that wasn’t my reality.</p><p>Instead, I was called “ugly”, “disgusting”, “a walking disease” and the classic teen insult, “pizza face”, all for something I couldn’t change.</p><p>Would my life be easier if I wasn’t suffering with a skin condition? Would people treat me better? The constant bullying was soul-destroying, and so were the questions in my mind.</p><p>I became depressed and felt like the acne was ruining my life, reducing me to tears on an almost daily basis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/credit-Instagram_emeraldxbeauty.jpg><p>For the rest of my school life I was a regular at my GP surgery, constantly trying new medications – from topical creams to antibiotics.</p><p>Some contraceptive pills can help with acne, but after reading about possible side effects, I didn’t want to take the risk.</p><p>After seeing a dermatologist, I tried Roaccutane, an anti-inflammatory drug only prescribed in severe cases to reduce oil production and bacteria – all with no real success.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The now much-publicised side effects of taking Roaccutane</a> took over my life – I’d cry, get annoyed, angry and sad for no reason.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/234c5d9b-1300-4433-b645-0167ef683e93.jpg><p>So by the time I left school, I’d stopped the meds and turned to the high street, spending thousands of pounds over the years on skincare.</p><p>Every time I saw an advert for a product claiming to fight acne, I ran straight out to buy it.</p><p>As my bank balance plummeted, so did my mental health. I felt ugly all the time, worthless, sad, depressed and stressed. But I was too scared of judgement to tell anyone about the toll it took on me.</p><p>After my experience at school, I vowed nobody would have the chance to bully me again, even if I still had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">severe acne</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000654206423.jpg><p>So when I started posting on social media, I turned to Photoshop – and I’m not the only one. Recent research by Dove found that by the age of 13, 80 per cent of girls are distorting the way they look online.</p><p>Heavily editing my images, to the point where I didn’t even recognise myself, became the norm, and I relished the praise these retouched images got: “Stunning”, “flawless”, “beautiful”.</p><p>I’d never received so many compliments. It felt good, but I knew they were based on a lie. I saw myself beneath all the make-up and Photoshop, and the reality was far from flawless. I felt like a fraud.</p><p>I didn’t want to contribute to the false beauty standards we see online and in some advertising. I wanted to show the world who I am, so people could see someone real on social media.</p><h3 class=article-boxout__headline>Busting the breakout myths</h3><p><strong>YOUR DIET IS CAUSING YOUR BREAKOUTS</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Whether it’s fast food, chocolate, or dairy, there is limited scientific evidence that food causes acne. I’m a vegan and have been for the past year, yet I still have spots.</p><p><strong>ACNE IS CAUSED BY POOR HYGIENE</strong></p><p>While washing your face, towels and pillowcases regularly is important, it’s not going to solve the problem, and having acne doesn’t mean you’re dirty.</p><p><strong>MAKE-UP MAKES IT WORSE</strong></p><p>Most cosmetics face rigorous testing, but if you’re worried about blocking pores, opt for non-comedogenic products and always make sure you remove make-up before bed.</p><p><strong>ACNE IS INFECTIOUS</strong></p><p>Despite what the bullies say, you’re not a walking disease. Although picking spots can cause more near the original breakout, they don’t spread from person to person.</p><p>So, aged 20, I dropped the filters on my @Emeraldxbeauty Instagram page and embraced my acne. I loved the positive reaction from people, but with the honesty also came cyberbullying.</p><p>I couldn’t believe how much someone’s appearance could provoke such hateful comments, especially from strangers. Thankfully, I get twice as many supportive ones.</p><p>Dropping the filters has changed me as a person and I want to give people a different kind of role model from the retouched images in adverts. You don’t have to be perfect to be beautiful – you are beautiful no matter what.</p><p>Growing up, I never thought I could love myself, and my skin, the way I do today. While nothing so far has cured my acne, I have found things that help…</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>My skin-saving routine&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/7a0d8dc9-5de4-4b66-94d7-a377b526790d.jpg><ul><li>Nip+Fab Charcoal + Mandelic Fix Cleansing Pads, £14.95 for 60</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SMF23MAYBEAUTYACNE003.jpg><ul><li>Murad InvisiScar Resurfacing Treatment, £35,</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SMF23MAYBEAUTYACNE002.jpg><ul><li>Foreo Luna 3, £169</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SMF23MAYBEAUTYACNE004.jpg><ul><li>Murad Prebiotic 4-In-1 MultiCleanse, £38</li></ul><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TM-comp-Mystic-Meg-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">MYSTIC MEG</h3><p>May 23: Love has a fitness link and red sportswear is a signal</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/COMP-MA-RINGS.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">RING TRUE</h3><p>Ex-Pandora worker exposes cheating man who bought rings for girlfriend & mistress</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/COMP-MA-HINCH-BABY.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">IT’S A BOY</h3><p>Mrs Hinch gives birth to son Lennie Alan as she says her ‘heart is so full’</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MT-DOCTOR-COMP.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">A WEE BIT</h3><p>Doc reveals why your wee might be smelly & when you need to seek medical advice</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/COMP-CFP-TATTOOv1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">TATTS SAD</h3><p>Dad spends 45 hours getting ink for lost babies, including son who lived 27 days</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/COMP-KE-TWIN-UP-GRAN.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">TATTS MAD</h3><p>I’m a gran & I’ve spent £25k covering my body in tattoos, it’s taken five years</p><h3 class=article-boxout__headline>Vote now!</h3><p class=article__content--intro>VOTE for your favourite premium skincare brand in our Beauty awards and win some amazing prizes.</p><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Love Island’s Amy Hart on coping with acne, make-up techniques and cringe beauty trends</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkqq5rbXErGScmZyhsqV5zJ5krp%2BcrnqiusNmp6KyqpZ6p63CnmSbnZOWwrSxjKidZqWpYq6kusRmma6sXa68tnnDqKWtZZ6asqV5z56pn52TqXq0t8inZK2nXZeybq7EmqytoZaquXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dee-smarts-horrendous-journey-from-home-and-away-to-the-archibald.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dee Smarts horrendous journey from Home and Away to the Archibald</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brittany-furlan.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brittany Furlan Height, Weight, Age, Spouse, Family, Facts, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News -
