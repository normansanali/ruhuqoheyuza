This tactic might have a slightly different effect than he’d hoped, which he realized — to his utter annoyance — thanks to the angry reaction to his fat-shaming twitter rant that has already been viewed 30 million times.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>The former MMA champion fought in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UFC</a> before he was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">banned for assault</a> (which is ironic) by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dana White</a>, who recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slapped his own wife</a>, yet somehow neglected to ban himself for that assault. At any rate, Shields is obviously in tip-top shape, thanks to it basically being his job, and also thanks to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">taking banned substances</a>, allegedly steroids. Nonetheless, he’s a pretty good fighter, earning a record of 33-11.</p><p data-characters=105 data-current-count=105 data-injectable=false>He’s also obviously not shy about expressing how he feels, and this time it has led to heavy blowback.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>It all started when Shields posted a photo of a woman’s body he did not exactly take a liking to, and stated “This b*tch needs a gym membership, not a bikini.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>This bitch needs a gym membership, not a bikini <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2uKfDyzLI6</a></p>— Jake Shields (@jakeshieldsajj) <a href=#>April 12, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>It’s worth noting that Shields likely failed to verify whether the woman already has a gym membership, and if she does, whether it would have prevented him from calling her a “b*tch.”</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>Jake received immediate pushback for his anti-bikini stance.
