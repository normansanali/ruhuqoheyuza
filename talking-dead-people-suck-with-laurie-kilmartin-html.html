But even with as much ground as she covered in that hour, she wasn’t done there. Today marks the release of Kilmartin’s new book </span><a href=#><i><span style=font-weight:400>Dead People Suck: A Guide for Survivors of the Newly Departed</span></i></a><span style=font-weight:400>. Rather than an encyclopedic volume of all things mourning, it’s a targeted guide that the author describes as “…aimed at my own sort of pain, the middle-aged loss of an older person…I wanted to start in chronological order and go from the dying person, to you’re in hospice, to you’re dead, to what do we do with this dead person, and how do we get over it or keep going.” The result is a hilarious, revealing, and unconventionally practical walk through loss and grief. I talked to Kilmartin about the new book, the deal she made with her unborn child, and leaving death behind.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn7k03j4vbmc93irbfgv@published data-word-count=19><b>I’m glad we had time to chat.

A lot of times when you’re dealing with a tragedy you feel guilty about doing very normal things and having very normal feelings, as if doing those things and having those feelings takes away from the tragedy itself. One of those ways that works is with sex. You have chapters like </b><b><i>Never Leave Your Dying Loved One’s Side Unless of Course It Is to Have Sex</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>All Those Sex Acts You Would Never Try While Your Parents Were Still Alive? Time to Party</i></b><b>. I found those oddly comforting.

I had written a lot of notes when my dad was dying because I knew I would forget a lot of stuff. I wanted to be able to remember it. I didn’t want it to be a blur. I had tons of notes to go from. Sometimes it was therapeutic, but other times I would wake up early to work on it and go, “I don’t want to feel this bad at 7:00am.” But to write a chapter properly I had to go back to that feeling and walk myself through it again so I could come up with the best jokes about it. It was slightly therapeutic, and I feel like, “Wow, I’m really done with it now.” I’m looking forward to not using my dad’s death as a source of potential material for anything.
