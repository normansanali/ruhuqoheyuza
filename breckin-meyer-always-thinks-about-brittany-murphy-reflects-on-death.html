The actor reflected on how talented Murphy was and how he would love to see what she could have accomplished.</p><p>“Britt passed away as an adult, but she’s one of those people who I always think about. I wish I could see what she would have done now,” Meyer said before recalling how “crazy talented” the actress was on and off screen.</p><p>“Only the surface had been dealt with,” he said about her career at the time of her death. “She was such a good singer, and seeing how many people cross over into music and movies, I was like, ‘Oh, I would have loved to see Brittany do that.'”</p><p>Meyer and Murphy played love interests Travis Birkenstock and Tai Frasier, respectively, in 1995’s Clueless. The pair went on to work together for eight years on the animated series King of the Hill.</p><p>Meyer described Murphy as “the sun,” explaining, “She was so effervescent and great and for her to pass away like that, in such a s—ty way and in such a toxic relationship, just was so terrible.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Breckin-Meyer-Reflects-on-Brittany-Murphys-Death-Wishes-He-Could-See-What-She-Would-Have-Done-2.jpg><p>Murphy <a href=#>collapsed in the bathroom</a> of her Los Angeles home after dealing with an illness for many days. The coroner determined her cause of death to be pneumonia, combined with anemia and “multiple drug intoxication” that were both prescription and over the counter, including cold medicine and painkillers.</p><p>At the time, Murphy was married to <strong>Simon Monjack</strong>. They wed in April 2007, and their relationship was riddled with ups and downs before her 2009 death.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Assistant LA Coroner <strong>Ed Winter</strong> said after Murphy’s passing, per multiple outlets, “She had been sick at least two weeks. Had they taken her to a doctor or hospital, it would have been treatable.”</p><p>Following the Uptown Girls actress’ sudden death, suspicions turned to her husband, who denied any allegations that he was responsible for her death. “It’s utterly ridiculous that these rumors have [been] perpetuated,” Monjack said in a bizarre tell-all interview with Today in January 2010.</p><p>Five months later, in May 2010, Monjack was found dead in his and Murphy’s home at age 40. His cause of death was eerily similar to his wife’s, and the Los Angeles coroner declared Monjack died of acute pneumonia and severe anemia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpWYuKq6jKacsp2iYq6tw8CyqmasmJ67rL%2BMmpmoraRir7O1062Yp7FdosKzvMeyZKudlqGypMDSZqanZZSarrW0jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./britney-spears-reveals-why-she-shaved-head-2007-paparazzi-mental-health-crisis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Britney Spears Finally Addresses Why She Shaved Her Head In 2007 As Her Mental Health Is Questioned</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./abandoned-asylums.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>9 Abandoned Asylums That Will Make Your Skin Crawl</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
