The Scottish DJ and the R&B singer recently went on a date following his high-profile June 1 split from — and subsequent feud with — ex&nbsp;</span><b><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></b><span>, multiple sources confirm to </span><i>Us Weekly</i><span>.</span></p><p>The duo got together because Tinashe “wanted to talk music, but Calvin is so into her and she thinks he’s cute,” a source close to the “All Hands on Deck” songstress tells <i>Us</i>. “It’s very, very early and we’ll see where it goes, but they are both into each other.”</p><p><span>A source close to Harris, however, adds, “It was just going out. No idea where it will end up going.”</span></p><p>The EDM producer, 32, and the stunning pop star, 23, first met in 2014 when they were reportedly writing songs together for <b><a href=#>Rihanna</a></b>. They later collaborated on two tracks of their own — “5 AM” and “Dollar Signs,” the latter of which appeared on his 2014 album, <i>Motion</i>.</p><p>Tinashe is currently wrapping up recording her long-awaited sophomore album, <i>Joyride</i>, which is scheduled to be released later this year.</p><p>Earlier this week, she released a new ’90s-inspired single titled “Superlove” from the forthcoming album. On the uptempo retro R&B track, Tinashe croons, “They will never love you, babe / Like I love you, babe / Baby, say you’ll never take my love away.”</p><p>During a recent interview with <a href=#>Fuse</a>, the “Aquarius” singer revealed her inspiration behind the summer-friendly hit. “It’s about that, when you first fall for someone and you feel super crazy, like you kinda lost your mind a little bit because you’re super into them,” she explained to the news outlet on Friday, July 15. “That’s the energy that I want to have all summer. Just fun, over-the-top happiness.”</p><p>Tinashe isn’t the only one looking for fun this summer. Just two weeks after splitting from Harris, Swift, 26, quickly moved on to her new beau, <b><a href=#>Tom Hiddleston</a></b>. Since then, the happy couple have traveled to England, Italy and Australia together and even celebrated at the “Blank Space” singer’s annual <a href=#>July 4th bash</a> at her seaside home in Rhode Island.</p><p>Last week, Harris <a href=#>slammed his ex-girlfriend</a> for trying to make him “look bad” after it was revealed that she helped write his summer smash “This Is What You Came For.” “I figure if you’re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do,” he wrote via Twitter on Wednesday, July 13.</p><span class=caption></span><p>More recently, Swift made headlines for the drama surrounding her <a href=#>phone call</a> with <b><a href=#>Kanye West</a></b> after <b><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></b> shared a series of Snapchat videos of West and Swift chatting on the phone about his song “Famous.” In the clips, which were posted on Sunday, July 17, the blonde bombshell seemingly gives her approval to the MC to include the controversial lyric: “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After the phone call recordings were released, Swift shared an Instagram note, claiming she wasn’t informed that she’d be referred to as “that bitch” in the NSFW song. “Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009,” she wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZyrtq95x5qpq6GjYsSmutNmpqdlkWKxosDEZq6irJhiwaq6wKyfnmWUmsGitcusZLBsYm6Ecn%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./candy-spelling-net-worth-2024-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Candy Spelling Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ariel-helwani-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-his-net-worth-in-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ariel Helwani: A Comprehensive Analysis of His Net Worth in 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
