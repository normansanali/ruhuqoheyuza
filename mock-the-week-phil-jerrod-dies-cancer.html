He will be sorely missed by all who knew him."</p><p>It is not known how long Phil had been secretly battling sarcoma, a rare form of cancer.</p><p>Phil, thought to be 41, supported Channel 4 star Romesh Ranganathan on his UK tour in 2016.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News TV</h2></p><p>The heartbroken comic said today: "Phil Jerrod was one of my very best friends and I loved him dearly.</p><p>"He was a brilliant comic, but more importantly one of the kindest and loveliest men you could ever meet.</p><p>"You would always feel better for having spent time with him.

He has been told that he will not be able to work for three months after the op. &nbsp;Now, as self-employed comedians, we know that we don't have such luxuries as sick pay etc.</p><p>"And cancelling an Edinburgh run and 3 months worth of work is a big ol' deal. &nbsp;I really don't want Phil and Beck (his lovely wife) to be worrying about making ends meet while they should be concentrating on Phil getting back to full fitness.
