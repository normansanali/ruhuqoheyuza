What Season of ‘The Bachelorette’ Was Aven Jones On?</b></h3><p class=p1>Aven first appeared on season 19 of <a href=#><i>The Bachelorette</i></a>, ultimately deciding to pursue Rachel over her co-lead <a href=#><strong>Gabby Windey</strong></a>. He made it all the way to the final two before Rachel, 27, dumped him over <a href=#>his hesitancy to get engaged</a> on the accelerated timeline. (Rachel ended up <a href=#>accepting a proposal</a> from <a href=#><strong>Tino Franco</strong></a>, but they split several weeks later after <a href=#>he kissed another woman</a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Who-Is-Aven-Jones-5-Things-to-Know-About-the-Bachelor-in-Paradise-Season-9-Contestant-009.jpg><h3 class=p3><b>2. Where Does Aven Jones Stand With Rachel Recchia?</b></h3><p class=p1>After fans watched Rachel and Tino’s emotional breakup during the September 2022 season finale, the exes <a href=#>reunited on <i>After the Final Rose</i></a>. When the conversation reached a stalemate, Aven <a href=#>made a surprise appearance</a> to escort Rachel off the set — and ask her out on a date.</p><p class=p1>“I just care about him so much that I genuinely just want him to be happy in whatever capacity that is with me or, like, whatever it is. I just really want to see him just thriving,” Rachel later gushed about Aven <a href=#>during an October 2022 appearance on the “Off the Vine” podcast</a>. “So what’s to come? I don’t know. I mean, I’m definitely open to seeing what happens but it’s two people, we’ve been through so much,” Rachel said. “I just got back to L.A. from everything that happened [on the] show — New York, I was in Vegas. So I think we’re both kind of just going to see where it goes — if it goes anywhere.”</p><h3 class=p3><b>3. Why Was Aven Jones Involved in ‘Bachelor in Paradise’ Season 8 Drama?</b></h3><p class=p1>While Aven did not appear on<a href=#> <i>Bachelor in Paradise </i>season 8</a>, he was allegedly supposed to attend the reunion.</p><p class=p1>“Crazy. I initially got invited to go to the reunion to support my boys,” he <a href=#>wrote via Twitter (now X)</a> in November 2022. “Wonder why I got disinvited <span class=s1>🧐</span>.”</p><p class=p1>Aven had claimed that the show extended an invitation so that he could be there for his season 19 pals Tyler and<a href=#><strong> Johnny DePhillipo</strong></a>. (After their respective failed romances with <a href=#><strong>Brittany Galvin</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Victoria Fuller</strong></a>, Aven took to Twitter to defend his friends’ parts in the breakups.)</p><h3 class=p3><b>4. What Does Aven Jones Do for a Living?</b></h3><p class=p1>When Aven joined <i>The Bachelorette</i>, he was working as a sales representative in San Diego, California. He has since jumped into the influencer space.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3 class=p3><b>5. How Did Aven Jones Join the Bachelor Nation Franchise?</b></h3><p class=p1>“I got nominated anonymously, so I still to this day don’t know who nominated me,” he said during a September 2022 interview on the <a href=# rel=noopener>“Click Bait With Bachelor Nation” </a>podcast. “I still don’t know. Every time I hang out with a group of friends or family members, I’m always looking around the room trying to figure out which one of them was it. I got contacted by the show and had some conversations with my parents asking if they thought it was a good idea.”</p><p class=p1>Aven added: “My dad wasn’t into the show, but my mom had caught a couple seasons. She thought it was fake and couldn’t be real, but now they’ve seen.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6hp12ewG6t1Z6lZqKfo7K0ecyenK1lpJ2ybq7AnJ%2BepJ%2Bneqq6jKmYq5mUnsCmedKemKynnmKGbr%2FTmqlo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anthony-richardson-net-worth-how-much-is-anthony-richardson-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Anthony Richardson net worth: How much is Anthony Richardson worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mindy-project-recap-season-3-episode-20-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Mindy Project Recap: Laverne and Sheena</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
