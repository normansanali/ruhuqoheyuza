lords, in the Netflix series but the real Griselda's family has filed a suit calling on a judge to halt the release of the series which is set to drop next week on January 25, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJM8XoEE3hc data-wc=29>Netflix has pitched the show as "fictionalized dramatization inspired by the life of the savvy and ambitious Griselda Blanco, who created one of the most powerful cartels in history".&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Sofia Vergara looks unrecognizable as she transforms into Griselda Blanco</figure><p id=ep3jjgqtGx data-wc=32>"Set in 1970s-80s Miami, Blanco’s lethal blend of unsuspected savagery and charm helps her expertly navigate between business and family, leading her to become widely known as 'the Godmother'," the synopsis reads.&nbsp;</p><p id=eA3MuxLdIw data-wc=50>But the filing alleges that Griselda's son Michael has been taking part in interviews for many years – between 2009 to 2022 — with producers who were hoping to develop his mother's story into a film or TV series, and in 2016 they began shopping the idea to Hollywood executives.&nbsp;</p><p id=ed_D79LGXG data-wc=44>According to the suit, which has been seen by <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>, "Michael claims he was then told Netflix was interested" but that the streaming service did not want to use any of his own personal details from the interviews or include him as a consultant.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

series does use many of his own anecdotes and family stories, and so he and his siblings are suing the streaming service – and Sofia, who is an executive producer on the project.&nbsp;</p><p

the lovable Gloria Delgado-Pritchett in the comedy – a role she had for 11 years.

"I don't understand many things about her but I took on the role because I'm Colombian, I'm a woman, I'm a mother and I'm an immigrant."&nbsp;</p><p id=eFUwJf_261 data-wc=33>"I don't feel like I need a man. I mean, no, I want one but I don't need one," she said with a laugh, referencing herz<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;2023 divorce from second husband Joe Manganiello.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uaGpuaWl8tLvFophmrpWntKK%2BwGalmqWVmXqquoylmLCrpZ7BbrvVnqlmrZ6WwrW0zqugrJ2UYrumw4ynnK2enJ7Fbr%2FEq6Ceq12cv6q%2FxKWbmmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./southern-charm-star-madison-lecroy-got-married-to-brett-randle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Southern Charm Star Madison LeCroy Got Married To Brett Randle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./phasmophobia-all-halloween-2023-recipe-ingredient-locations.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Phasmophobia: All Halloween 2023 Recipe Ingredient Locations</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
