He's due about $24 million this season, which will put him at $180 million over his 15-year career.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Meanwhile, </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>Stephen Curry</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>James Harden</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> both just signed massive extensions with the Warriors and Rockets, respectively, that will pay each of them more than $200 million. In a third of the time, they'll make more money than Wade has during his entire career.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Wade averaged 18.3 points and 43 percent last season. Wade tweeted earlier this summer that if he were 25 instead of 35, that kind of performance would earn him a $150 million contract.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-229070 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-633041984.jpg alt width=900 height=713 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-229070 class=wp-caption-text>Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That might be an overestimation – the closest comparisons around age 25 might be <a href=# title="Victor Oladipo Net Worth">Victor Oladipo</a> (24 years old, 15.9 PPG, 44% shooting) and <a href=# title="Dion Waiters Net Worth">Dion Waiters</a> (25 years old, 15.8 PPG, 42% shooting). Oladipo is making $21 million per year and Waiters just signed a four-year, $52 million deal to remain in Miami. Even players with better numbers, like <a href=# title="Harrison Barnes Net Worth">Harrison Barnes</a> (26 years old, 19.2 PPG, 47% shooting) won't make nearly as much as Wade this coming season.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, Wade isn't wrong in his assessment of young players getting huge contracts. Curry and Harden are among the elite and the argument could be made that they're worth their big deals.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It's when you start looking at players like <a href=# title="Gordon Hayward Net Worth">Gordon Hayward</a> where it gets murky. Hayward is a very good, All-Star level player. But is he a superstar? He'll certainly be getting paid like one in Boston, where he signed a </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>four-year, $128 million deal</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> this offseason.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Wade's tweet was more a comment on the current state of the league, where teams have ample amounts of money to dish out. And while several franchises are thinking more long-term – particularly with the Warriors set to dominate the league over the next few years – there's still a minimum amount of cash to spend each year.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As the salary cap continues to rise, don't be surprised to see more deals like the one Hayward signed. Teams are going to overpay on good to great players, hoping that player is the missing piece to a championship.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>More often than not, it won't work out. But that won't stop teams from trying. And while Wade might be upset that he left millions on the table in Miami, he'll make more this year than a lot of the younger guys putting up comparable numbers. Maybe there is an advantage to being an old dog, after all. &nbsp;</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-229069 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-474315278.jpg alt width=900 height=657 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-229069 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqyrnqiYmrtur9SrqbJlmpa6pr%2BMoZirnJWjwG6vzqerq5mTqXqmxNOepayhn6PAbsPOq6uhZZSsxqK6xGaumpyVYrqisMRmnKesmaeybq%2FAq5yeql8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-billionaires-of-the-nba-unveiling-the-wealthiest-players-in-the-game.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Billionaires of the NBA: Unveiling the Wealthiest Players in the Game</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./smash-mouth-shades-taylor-swifts-new-music-dylan-obrien-responds.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Smash Mouth Shades Taylor Swift's New Music, Dylan O'Brien Responds</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
