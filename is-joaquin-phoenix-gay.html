They initially got to know one another while on the set of the movie “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Her</a>” in 2013, but they didn’t start dating until a few years later.</p><p>Only a few aspects of the couple’s relationship are known to the general public since they want to keep their private lives secret. They have, however, occasionally been in public together and captured on camera at different occasions and award ceremonies.</p><p>In the 2019 movie “Mary Magdalene,” Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix collaborated once more on the project. Mara played the title role, while Phoenix played Jesus Christ. They probably have a lot in common because of their love of acting and commitment to their jobs.</p><p>It was revealed in September 2020 that the couple had given birth to a baby they had named River in honor of Joaquin Phoenix’s late brother. It took several months before the public was informed of this news.</p><p>The relationship between Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix has been characterized as low-key and private since both performers like to keep their private lives apart from their public personas.
