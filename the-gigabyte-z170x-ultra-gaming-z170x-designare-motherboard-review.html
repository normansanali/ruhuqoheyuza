Its current selling price of $156 is cheaper than expected for a quality gaming motherboard, lower even than Gigabyte's popular GA-Z170X-Gaming 7 model (<a href=#>$180</a>) that has no U.2 support. It is important to note that despite recent innovations in the motherboard space, such as slot protection, the lower cost over the Gaming 7 does bring some compromises in extra controller support.</p><p>The GA-Z170X-Ultra Gaming has one U.2 connector, one M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 slot, two SATA Express connectors and a total of six SATA 6Gb/s connectors. The one Intel I219-V network controller is paired with the Realtek ALC892 audio codec, which is surprising&nbsp;to see on a gaming motherboard (normally we see the ALC1150, or at a pinch, the ALC898). We expected the downgrade from the expensive Creative Core3D audio chip, and on the networking the decision for Intel is interesting given GIGABYTE's close relationship with Rivet Network's Killer team, so we had expected to see a single Killer E2400/E2500 network controller. A TPM header is present, as well as a header for an add-in Thunderbolt card, but there is no COM header on the GA-Z170X-Ultra Gaming (compared to the more expensive Gaming 7).</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/10935/GBGZ170_07_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><span>The sharing of bandwidth between the two PCIe x16 slots is typical, meaning that the top one will operate in x16 mode if a card is not installed in the second, or in in x8&nbsp;</span>mode <span>if cards are installed in both of them.&nbsp;</span>Despite the Z170 chipset having 20 PCIe lanes to use, there is some sharing going on here. The PCIe x4 slot shares its bandwidth with the SATA 0/1 connectors, so the SATA connectors will be disabled if a PCIe x4 device is installed there. Similarly, the U.2 slot shares its bandwidth with the SATA 2/3 connectors and the M.2 slot with the SATA 4/5 connectors. If you want to install a PCIe x4 device, a U.2 drive and a M.2 drive at the same time, the SATA connectors will all be inoperable. A PCIe x2 or slower device will not disable the SATA 0/1 connectors.</p><h4><strong>Gigabyte GA-Z170X-Designare Overview ($220)</strong></h4><p>Unlike its cheaper sibling, the GA-Z170X-Designare does not have a very specific target group. It seems as if GIGABYTE is trying to promote the board towards designers and engineers, or generally users that require the use of a professional graphics adapter. These cards hardly require a specialized motherboard though, and the GA-Z170X-Designare comes with many features that would be of general rather than targeted use. As such, the motherboard feels as an attempt to satiate engineers and professionals who entertain building a hybrid between a workstation and a gaming PC, or gamers who need something more feature-packed than the GA-Z170X-Ultra Gaming and can afford to pay the more premium price for it ($220 at the time of this review).</p><p>Much like the GA-Z170X-Ultra Gaming, the primary selling point of the GA-Z170X-Designare is that it can support U.2 drives. It only has one U.2 physical connector but, with the use of proper adapters, it can support up to three U.2 drives at once. It has two SATA Express connectors and a total of six SATA 6Gb/s connectors. Gigabyte installed dual LAN on this model, with two Intel network controllers present (I219-V + I211-AT). The network interfaces are supported by the cFosSpeed software. The&nbsp;audio codec is the Realtek ALC1150, which may not be equivalent to solutions coming from Creative, but it certainly is a very good product and a notable improvement over the ALC892/ALC898. Once again, TPM and Thunderbolt card headers are present, as well as an extra header for optional RGB LED strips. It is interesting to note that there is no COM header, and that can be a serious omission on a motherboard that is aimed towards professionals, especially engineers, however we rarely see it on non-IPC motherboards at this price. Last but not least, the&nbsp;<span>GA-Z170X-Designare features GIGABYTE's Turbo B-Clock IC, a chip that allows for, in theory, better BCLK overclocking.</span></p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/10935/GBGZ170_27_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><span>Exactly like its sibling, the GA-Z170X-Designare shares bandwidth between the two PCIe x16 slots, meaning that the top will operate in x16 mode if a card is not installed in the second slot, or in x8&nbsp;</span>mode <span>if cards are installed in both of them.&nbsp;</span>Also like with the GA-Z170X-Ultra Gaming, the GA-Z170X-Designare implements the same chipset (Intel Z170), which has 20 PCIe lanes. These 20 lanes are not enough to cover every feature of the motherboard, meaning that sharing was once again inevitable. &nbsp;The PCIe x4 slot shares its bandwidth with the SATA 0/1 connectors, so the SATA connectors will be disabled if a PCIe x4 device is installed there. Similarly, the U.2 slot shares its bandwidth with the SATA 2/3 connectors and the M.2 slot with the SATA 4/5 connectors. If you want to install a PCIe x4 device, a U.2 drive and an M.2 drive at the same time, the SATA connectors will all be inoperable. A PCIe x2 or slower device will not disable the SATA 0/1 connectors.</p><table border=1 id=pclist width=100%><tbody readability=4.4520639147803><tr><td align=center class=contentwhite colspan=3><strong>Motherboard Comparison</strong></td></tr><tr class=tlgrey readability=5><td width=30%>&nbsp;</td><td width=35%>GIGABYTE Z170X-Designare</td><td width=35%></td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Socket</td><td>LGA1151</td><td>LGA1151</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>MSRP at Review</td><td><a href=#>$220</a></td><td><a href=#>$143</a></td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>DRAM</td><td>4 x DDR4</td><td>4 x DDR4</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>PCIe Layout</td><td>x8/x8</td><td>x16</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>BIOS Version Tested</td><td>F20</td><td>1.11</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>MCT Enabled Automatically?</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>USB 3.1 (10 Gbps)</td><td>Intel Alpine Ridge</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>M.2 Slots</td><td>1 x PCIe 3.0 x4</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>U.2 Ports</td><td>1 x PCIe 3.0 x4</td><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=tlgrey>Network Controller</td><td>1 x Intel I219-V<br>1 x Intel I211-AT</td><td>1 x Intel I219-V</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>Audio Controller</td><td>Realtek ALC1150</td><td>Realtek ALC1150</td></tr><tr><td class=tlgrey>HDMI 2.0</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH5xhZJuZq2glWK0qrPAm7CtnV2vfnh812aspayilnqorcyipaBlqmaEccSMnZysoZejrrOxjKamraCVp6%2BwrdGdZKudpp6yuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mindy-project-recap-season-3-episode-20-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Mindy Project Recap: Laverne and Sheena</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./southern-charm-star-madison-lecroy-got-married-to-brett-randle.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Southern Charm Star Madison LeCroy Got Married To Brett Randle</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
