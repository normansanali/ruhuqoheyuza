On July 26, 1983, in Washington, D.C., West shined as one of the few talented and fierce point guards, he played nine seasons in the NBA and collected an estimated $16 million for his career.</p><h2>The Glorious Days in the NBA</h2><p>West started his NBA career in 2004 after being drafted as the No. 24 overall selection by the Boston Celtics. Throughout his many years of playing for the Celtics, Seattle SuperSonics, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Dallas Mavericks, he is likely the man who brought to the court and off the court some impressive things to watch and listen to. There were glimpses of brilliance during his career that showed just how truly talented and valuable he was for the teams he played with.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Difficult Times And Homelessness</h2><p>Yet, the ripples of West's hardship began haunting the basketball fraternity. The former NBA All-Star struggled with crippling emotional disturbances and addiction issues post-retirement. He soon turned to the streets and was later spotted wandering the streets homeless, fighting his demons. Disturbing return to the U.S. followed by photos of him panhandling in Dallas at an intersection and camping out near a 7-11 store in Virginia asking for money.</p><h2>The Compassion of Mark Cuban</h2><p>As West continued en route to Dallas, through their treacherous journey a light of hope finally emerged in Mark Cuban the owner of the Dallas Mavericks. Cuban stepped in to help West in 2020, picking him up off of the streets, paying for his treatment, and giving him a place to stay. According to the NBA, it was a display of unity that showed when all else fails, the basketball world still supports one another and does not turn its back on their fellow brother or sister.</p><h2>The Unconquerable Spirit</h2><p>Despite the best efforts of Cuban and the help of friends, former teammates, and NBA personnel rallied to aid West, the road to recovery for the 44-year-old has been an up-and-down experience. Unable to maintain the momentum gained by Cuban and spotted back on the streets in Virginia again, he has a long road ahead of him on his way to redemption. It is a powerful reminder of the war we wage against the suffering of addiction and mental health with Cuban's sobering reflection on his inability to help the West.</p><h2>The Human Spirit Will Prevail</h2><p>The Plight of Delonte West is a powerful story about the intricacies and frailties of the human condition that goes beyond sports and speaks to the universal struggles that all people face in life. The post highlights the absolute importance of mental health advocacy and advocacy for all people struggling with mental health, which is something every individual can relate to.</p><p>At the very least, it was an impressive reminder of how deeply ingrained the spirit of the NBA brotherhood runs and how many people in that community pulled together in such a concerted effort to help an ex-NBA player shape his active mind. To wrap up things, the story of Delonte West has had quite the journey&nbsp;in life, one packed with unfounded optimism and a descent into darkness, yet somehow always maintaining hope. The show goes far beyond the realms of sports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfrLWiwIyrnJqknK56qa3PqZynnZRiwbB5w56jqKakmnq4sdKt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carter-and-renee-love-is-blind.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Were Renee and Carter Cut from Love Is Blind?
