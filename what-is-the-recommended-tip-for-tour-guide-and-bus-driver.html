Factors such as the destination and the local customs can also influence the tipping norms. In some countries or regions, tipping is expected, while in others, it may not be as common. It is always a good idea to research the tipping etiquette of your travel destination beforehand to ensure you adhere to the local customs.</p><h3><span id=FAQs_about_Tipping_Tour_Guides_and_Bus_Drivers>FAQs about Tipping Tour Guides and Bus Drivers</span></h3><h3><span id=1_Is_tipping_mandatory_for_tour_guides_and_bus_drivers>1.
