However, things shifted between the father-son duo when the couple announced in January 2020 that they were stepping back from their roles as senior members of the royal family.</p><p>A source told Us Weekly at the time that the <a href=#>Prince of Wales was “livid”</a> with his youngest son and blamed the former actress for the decision to distance themselves from the monarchy.</p><p>The pair completed their royal duties in March 2020 and <a href=#>relocated to her native California</a> with their son, <a href=#>Archie</a>. They kept mum about their departure for more than a year before <a href=#>sitting down for a CBS tell-all interview</a> in March 2021. While <a href=#>Charles did nothing but laugh when asked about Harry’s bombshell claims</a>, including that <a href=#>his father stopped talking to him</a> after he and Meghan shared their plans to step down, Harry’s willingness to go on the record only further fractured their relationship.</p><p>“Charles <a href=#>does not agree with Harry trashing his whole family</a> in public,” an insider revealed in March 2021. “Charles thinks these matters could have easily been addressed in private.”</p><p>Charles and his mother, <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, “had <a href=#>very different plans for how to respond” to the allegations</a>, with the prince wanting “to rebuke every claim made by Meghan and Harry,” according to a source. The monarch ultimately preferred to “take a more modest approach.”</p><p>Harry and Charles reunited in April 2021 for <a href=#>Prince Philip</a>’s <a href=#>funeral</a>, but they did not reconnect in a meaningful way. “Unfortunately, Harry and Charles didn’t resolve their differences when Harry returned to the U.K. They barely communicated,” an insider told Us at the time. “There definitely continues to be a huge wedge between the two.”</p><p>The source added that <a href=#>Charles was “still fuming” over the tell-all and “freezing Harry out,”</a> while Harry had not “forgiven his father for his lack of effort and support after he and Meghan decided to move.” Another insider revealed in May 2021 that <a href=#>Charles “may never forgive Harry.”</a></p><p>Harry made headlines later that month for <a href=#>criticizing Charles’ parenting</a> more than once. “Charles is <a href=#>boiling with anger and feels tortured by Harry</a> with his constant digs. He wishes he’d just let it drop,” a source told Us. “The general consensus within the royal family is to ignore Harry’s behavior, to avoid fanning the flames, but Charles is finding it hard to hold back. He really wants to defend himself.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Charles assumed the British throne in September 2022 following <a href=#>his mother’s death at age 96</a> — and he gave his youngest son a small shout-out <a href=#>during his first address</a> as monarch. “I want also to express my love for Harry and Meghan, as they continue to build their lives overseas,” he told viewers in the U.K. and its Commonwealth territories.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see Harry’s most eye-opening quotes about his relationship with Charles through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvbO1zZycZqCRp7%2B6edCupq2do2Kuo7vUrWSpqpmjsKZ5wqGYq6SVqHqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMqZ%2BorJ%2BofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rappers-who-ruined-their-careers-on-social-media.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rappers Who Ruined Their Careers On Social Media</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-apple-thunderbolt-display-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Power Consumption - The Apple Thunderbolt Display Review</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
