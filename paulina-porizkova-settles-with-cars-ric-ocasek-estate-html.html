Porizkova confirmed she settled with Ocasek’s estate while appearing on Los Angeles Magazine’s <a href=#>The Originals podcast</a> on Sunday, although she wasn’t at liberty to reveal the given amount. “I know exactly how much I’m owed under New York law, how much is due to me, and I am getting it,” she explained. “The estate is settling with me. That I cannot tell you, but I am gonna be fine. I am gonna be fine. I settled last week. There you go. I settled last week with the estate. They were very fair. They gave me what is mine under New York State law, and we’re done.” However, Porizkova disputed the widely reported claim that Ocasek’s estate was valued <a href=#>at only $5 million</a> — it’s more. “I’m totally fine with inheriting a half, which I thought was mine,” she continued. “Turns out it’s not a half under New York law; it’s a third.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckv84n2h4002d3e6kc4ic5vnu@published data-word-count=86>Porizkova <a href=#>has shared in several interviews</a> over the past year how Ocasek, the Cars’ front man and a prolific music producer, wrote her out of his will without informing her, a decision that she called a “<a href=#>betrayal.</a>” Despite the couple announcing their separation in 2017, they continued to live and attend public events together prior to his death, as well as maintain what Porizkova described as a close friendship. She was the one who discovered Ocasek’s body at their shared Gramercy Park townhouse in September 2019.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckv84itoq00293e6k5ixkitdp@published data-word-count=134>“I didn’t know how to make heads or tails out of anything,” she explained of Ocasek’s altered will on The Originals podcast. “My husband had some lawyers, and he was supposed to go through surgery. They just cobbled together a really fast, kind of stupid thing. I don’t think my husband had the brain capacity at the time to figure out what he was really doing. He was a bit of a hypochondriac anyway … I think he signed a piece of paper without spending a lot of time thinking about it.” Court documents obtained by “Page Six” <a href=#>stated</a> that Ocasek wrote Porizkova out of his will “because she has abandoned me” amid their divorce proceedings. The bulk of his estate will be going to his two sons shared with Porizkova, Oliver and Jonathan.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckosp47vt0000q8ogxmdg1c82@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Paulina Porizkova Recalls ‘Lonely’ and ‘Depressed’ Marriage to Ric Ocasek</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Paulina Porizkova Drives Home With Her Ric Ocasek Settlement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpamdhZXyxrdSloKeZXaW8s7XZpKavmV2osrXAy56qZq%2BZqbVur8CrqmaqmZh6sK%2FArJykZZWowaLAxGefraWc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./proud-parents-bald-eagles-in-west-virginia-welcome-newborn-chick-fish-and-wildlife-service-national-conservation-training-center-eagle-cam-shepherdstown-bella-smitty.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Proud parents: Bald eagles in West Virginia welcome newborn chick</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miles-teller-net-worth-how-much-is-the-whiplash-star-worth-in-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miles Teller Net Worth: How Much Is the Whiplash Star Worth in 2023?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
