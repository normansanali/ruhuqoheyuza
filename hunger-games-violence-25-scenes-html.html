For some of you, this date has been circled on the calendar for months. For others — perhaps those among you who do not live and die by young-adult-novel trends — the frenzy may still be a bit confusing, especially if you have reflexively grouped The Hunger Games along with Twilight and other teen fads of late. Why is everyone freaking out about another mopey kids book? you might be thinking, and on that point, you would be wrong. The Hunger Games is not just another kids’ book; The Hunger Games is actually a very dark, messed-up dystopian novel in which young children are forced to kill other children: Kids slaughtering kids, over and over, in graphic and disturbing ways. Except for the omission of rape, slightly bigger font, and far fewer pages, The Hunger Games is not much lighter fare than The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. But in case you are still not convinced, we have compiled a list of 25 truly fucked-up events that happen over the course of the first Hunger Games book, in the hopes that this evidence as to the story’s intensity will trump the book’s Barnes & Noble section placement. Necessarily, <strong>this post contains SPOILERS</strong>, though we have tried to make the points as unspecific as possible; but if you were of the school that had completely dismissed the book, perhaps these bloody bullets will let you know what you’re missing. (Also: Most of these instances are depicted in the film, although not always as gorily as Suzanne Collins described in her novel.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-98e072f281495a90aa5ecac699e0ead4-3-0-0@published data-word-count=36>- Each year, the Government (known as the Capitol) forces 24 children from its outlying oppressed districts to fight to the death, on television.
