The series launched the careers of some of our fav Jersey residents, Snooki, Jwoww, Mike, Pauly D, Vinny, Deena, and of course, Ronnie! While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronnie Ortiz-Magro</a> spent most of his time on the original show dating former cast members, Sammie Sweetheart, he managed to find love all over again once the two split for good. As the reunion show, <a href=#>'Jersey Shore: Family Vacation'</a>, came to fruition, Ronnie and his new relationship with Jen Harley, was a huge storyline.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two began dating back in 2017, and while things started off fine, their relationship took a turn for the worst only a few months in. During this time, Ronnie and Jen were expecting their first child together, a baby girl, which only made their toxic relationship even worse. While fans have a lot to say about Jen Harley, there's still a lot we don't know about her. Here's who Harley was before her relationship with 'Jersey Shore' star, Ronnie Ortiz-Magro.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's Why 'Jersey Shore' Fans Think Ronnie Has A New Girlfriend</a></span></p><h2 id=who-was-jen-harley-before-jersey-shore>Who Was Jen Harley Before 'Jersey Shore'?</h2><p>'Jersey Shore' first aired back in 2009, bringing light to a cast that would soon become one of the most talked-about people in the world. The show followed the lives of Snooki, JWoww, Vinny, Pauly, Mike, Ronnie, and Deena as they partied their lives away on the shore of Seaside Heights. The original series ended in 2012, leaving fans heartbroken over the end of 'Jersey Shore'. Luckily for viewers, MTV revived the show in 2017 with 'Jersey Shore: Family Vacation'. While we witnessed one toxic relationship with Ronnie and Sam the first time around, 'Family Vacation' was not short of another!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ronnie and baby mama, Jen Harley, first met in 2017, only a few months before the star was set to shoot the series reboot. Ronnie's relationship with Harley turned serious very fast after it was revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two were expecting their first child together</a>, a baby girl named Ariana Sky. While the couple's antics played out on-screen for fans to enjoy, things got too ugly to the point where viewers no longer wanted to see their mess of a relationship each week. While we know a lot about Jen and her chaotic ways today, who was she before meeting Ronnie?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Ronnie Magro’s Baby Mama Is Living It Up In The Bahamas</a></span></p><p>Well, if there is one thing that stands true, is that Jen Harley has always been a tough girl. Jen first moved to Las Vegas straight out of high school when she was only 18 years old. While details regarding her time in Sin City are limited, fans quickly became aware of Harley's troubled past, where she was arrested multiple times before even meeting Ronnie. In 2015, Jen was pulled over due to negligent driving where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she received her first DUI</a>. From then on, it appears as if her wild ways continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, only a few months before meeting Ronnie, Jen Harley was arrested yet again for lewd and lascivious conduct after stripping in a public hot tub. This all took place while Jen was raising her firstborn, Mason, who she had from a previous relationship. After meeting Ronnie, fans and his fellow cast members noticed a plethora of red flags, including the ones just mentioned, however, that didn't seem to be enough for Ronnie to walk away before children entered the picture.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Jersey Shore's Ronnie Accuses His Baby Mama Of Leaving Their Daughter With Friends While She Partied</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqqjmsZuv8eoqZ5lp52utXnJnqVmoJGnuabFjLCYrGWUpLavs4ybnJ%2Bnopp6o7HCqKSippdiv7C6zaKcrGWSlq%2B6ecyapJpn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gifts-for-squid-game-fans.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>19 Gifts for 'Squid Game' Fans That You Won't Need 45.6 Billion Won to Buy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-jim-nantzs-net-worth-in-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Jim Nantz's Net Worth in 2024?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
