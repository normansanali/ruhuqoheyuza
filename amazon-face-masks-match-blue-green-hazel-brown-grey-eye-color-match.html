These days, vanity is far from our greatest concern, especially when stepping out in public and practicing appropriate social distancing. But even though we’re wearing protective face coverings right now, it can’t hurt to add some fashionable flair to our everyday attire.</p><p>Though you may not be experimenting with new makeup techniques at the moment, you can still make your eyes stand out depending on which face mask you select. In fact, we found options that follow the tried-and-true makeup artist rules of which shades let your natural eye color seriously shine. They are all available on Amazon right now, so get to shopping!</p><p><strong>For Blue Eyes</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Papillons-Floral-Peach-Reusable-Face-Mask.png><p>If you have blue eyes, you can easily brighten them with contrasting neutral tones like beige or taupe. That may fly in the makeup world, but a brown face mask may not be your top choice! Softer peach shades are a great option to use for many skin tones, and this mask will effectively highlight those ocean eyes. The adorable dog print is just an added bonus!</p><p><strong><span class=word><span class=changedDisabled>Get the </span></span><span id=productTitle class=a-size-large><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Papillons Floral Peach Reusable Face Mask</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$12</a>, available at Amazon! </span></strong><strong><span class=word><span class=changedDisabled>Get it as soon as May 28, 2020. <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, May 12, 2020, but are subject to change.</span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>For Green and Hazel Eyes</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/YOSUNPING-Summer-Breathable-Face-Mask-Purple.png><p>One of the best hues to bring out green and hazel eyes is a deep, rich purple.

You can also opt to use other light brown shades, but we think that this purple face mask is the winning choice.</p><p><strong><span class=word><span class=changedDisabled>Get the </span></span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">REDESS </a><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Multifunctional Neck Headwear Face Mask</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$13</a>, available at Amazon! </span></strong><strong><span class=word><span class=changedDisabled>Get it as soon as May 21, 2020. <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, May 12, 2020, but are subject to change.</span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>For Brown Eyes</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Spikerking-Face-Mask-Scarf-Headwrap.png><p>For those who have brown eyes, consider yourself lucky, because nearly every color of the rainbow can help make them pop!
