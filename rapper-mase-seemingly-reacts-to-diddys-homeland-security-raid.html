His lawyer, <strong>Aaron Dyer</strong>, slammed the raids for being a “gross overuse of military-level force” in a statement to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> on Tuesday. “There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated.”</p><p>Dyer continued: “Mr. Combs was never detained but spoke to and cooperated with authorities. Despite media speculation, neither Mr. Combs nor any of his family members have been arrested nor has their ability to travel been restricted in any way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rapper-Mase-Reacts-to-Diddy-Homeland-Security-Raid-Years-After-Feud-Over-Music-Publishing-Rights-Inline-01.jpg><p>At the time, <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a> reported that two of Diddy’s <a href=#>sons</a> — Justin, 30, and King, 25 — were <a href=#>detained and later released</a> during the raids. Diddy was reportedly prevented from flying out of a <a href=#>Miami airport</a> by Homeland Security on Monday.</p><p>The musician, who is currently facing multiple sexual harassment and misconduct lawsuits, was <a href=#>spotted for the first time</a> since the raids on Friday, March 29. In photos obtained by the <a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Mail</a>, he appeared unbothered while leaving Top Golf Miami with his daughters Jessie and D’Lila, 17.</p><p>Mase’s history with Diddy goes back to 1997 when Mase released his debut album, Harlem World, under Diddy’s record label, Bad Boy Records. He went on to release two more albums under the label before accusing Diddy of withholding his music’s royalties from him.</p><p>“U still got my publishing from 24 years ago in which you gave me $20k. Which makes me never want to work w/t u as any artist wouldn’t after u know someone is robbing you & tarnishing your name when you don’t want to comply w/ his horrendous business model,” he wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> in January 2021.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rapper-Mase-Reacts-to-Diddy-Homeland-Security-Raid-Years-After-Feud-Over-Music-Publishing-Rights-Inline.jpg><p>Diddy subsequently claimed that Mase owed him $3 million during an October 2022 episode of <a href=# rel=noopener>The Breakfast Club</a> radio show. “That’s facts, I got the receipts,” he stated. “I’m not gonna go back and forth with Mase. I’m not going back and forth with nobody. I’m just gonna speak up for myself now.” Mase denied Diddy’s claims at the time.</p><p>In September 2023, Diddy gave back publishing rights to Mase and other Bad Boy Records artists, including Faith Evans, the Lox and 112, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a>.</p><p>“Everything’s cool and good now,” Diddy told <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard</a> of his and Mase’s drama later that month. “You know, we’re brothers and brothers fight. I love him and that’s it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarmaClsrN5zJqqnmWjmrKutc2go7JlopqupMDSZquoZZSesaXF0mafqKWVoa6vsIysnJytop7BunnRmqCdZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./110437-roger-goodell-net-worth-age-family-job-movies-salary-profiles-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Roger Goodell: net worth, age, family, job, movies, salary, profiles</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maniya-essence-canty-bio-age-net-worth-boyfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Maniya Essence Canty!
