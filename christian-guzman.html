But this genuineness and authenticity soon attracted a huge number of fans to his channel.</p><p>Christian Guzman, who thinks that “people like following a journey”, has been motivated by his subscribers to keep challenging himself and progress continuously.</p><p>This also means that he never gets a day off: to maintain transparency, he vlogs regularly, documenting his successes as well as failures. It also motivates him to stay positive to inspire his fans.</p><h4><span>Rise to YouTube</span></h4><p>As he doesn’t disconnect his personal life from his online presence, he thinks that his YouTube vlogging has become more akin to reality television shows, but with one significant difference: instead of beginning a frivolous life dedicated to bars and drinking, he focuses on becoming a better version of himself.</p><p>While YouTube changed his life goals entirely, ever since Christian succeeded in building his dream physique, he always wanted to hold weekly training classes to train younger kids and take them through workouts.</p><p>He also dreamed of opening a small facility to begin his coaching sessions. However, YouTube gave him a bigger and larger platform to share his knowledge with the world.</p><p>Christian later opened his warehouse and the Alphalete Gym in Houston, Texas, and has been selling his fitness and lifestyle products through the company Alphalete Athletics.</p><p>Late in 2015, Bodybuilding.com ran an article on him with the headline 300,000 People Watch Every Time He Trains! It represents him as one of the most widely recognized fitness YouTube personalities.</p><p>After being one of the most popular models of inspiration online, he set his sights further, in the hope of helping other people improve their physiques.</p><p>One of the most viewed videos on his channel is “I Bought My Dad A Car… This is His Reaction!!!.” It has almost 15 million views.</p><p>As of June 2020, he has garnered more than 991K subscribers, with almost 237 million total views.</p><h4><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>Alphalete Athletics</span></a></h4><p>Christian is the founder and CEO of the fitness apparel brand Alphalete Athletics.</p><p>He is also the owner and operator of the Alphalete Gym in Stafford, Texas, and per the LLC and Trademark registration, he is one of the 3 founders and owners of 3D energy drinks.</p><p>Following his YouTube success, he began the company Alphalete Athletics to sell fitness and later lifestyle apparel.</p><p>The clothing style is represented broadly as “athleisure” and is independently considered affordable but of high quality.</p><p>The company has been featured at international bodybuilding events such as BodyPower UK and is sold worldwide. He eventually opened an “industrial-style” Alphalete Gym in Houston, Texas.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>A fitness expert, Christian is available on different social media platforms. His Instagram has earned more than 1.2 million subscribers.</p><p>He is also active on Twitter with more than 125.1K followers. Likewise, he is available on Facebook with more than 124K followers.</p><p>His <strong>YouTube</strong> channel ‘Christian Guzman’ has earned over 991K subscribers.</p><h3 class=normal>More Fitness Instructor</h3><h3 class=normal>Christian Guzmán Fans Also Viewed</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmieoprAqbHRqaasrF6YvK57wqGpoquknq6vecausaaZnmQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./did-jenna-lyons-insult-ubah-hassans-hot-sauce-brand.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did Jenna Lyons insult Ubah Hassans hot sauce brand?
