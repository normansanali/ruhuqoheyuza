The following year he appeared in the 11th season of the show, again being runner-up.

She is an actress best known for her roles in The O.C. and Hart of Dixie. Though from two different realms, Bilson and Viall were briefly linked in 2019 after they were spotted hanging out. On Viall's podcast in 2023, the two revealed that they never dated and only saw each other for publicity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-has-nick-viall-dated>Who Has Nick Viall Dated?</h2><p>Nick Viall has appeared in more Bachelor Nation installations than most contestants. He was first season in the 10th season of The Bachelorette, but he was unable to find love. Viall tried again in the following season of the show, but once again left empty-handed. Bachelor in Paradise was a bust as well, and he finally got engaged as the 21st bachelor on The Bachelor.</p><p>His engagement to Vanessa Grimaldi did not last, however, and the two ended up parting ways before they even walked down the aisle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nick-viall.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grimaldi and Viall spoke for the first time post-split</a> on his YouTube channel in 2020 and addressed both their relationship and breakup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following his days in Bachelor Nation, Viall decided that dating someone connected to the franchise was not for him.

She also starred in the series Take Two, but the show was canceled after one season.

The two played love interests on the show and dated for almost the entirety of filming the four seasons. They were very close, but they parted ways after three years right before the premiere of the show's final season. The relationship had simply run its course.</p><p>Following her time with Brody, Bilson went on to date Star Wars star Hayden Christensen. They had met in 2008 while filming the movie Jumper, and by the end of the year the two were engaged. They split before getting married, but reconciled in 2010.</p><p>"I'm a really good girlfriend--I always put all that first in my life," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BIlson told Cosmopolitan about her relationship with Christensen</a> in 2013.
