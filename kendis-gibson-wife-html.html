He is a multi <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Emmy </a>award-winning&nbsp;journalist who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">describes</a> himself as a&nbsp;Brooklyn groomed dog dad. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The anchor is very passionate and focused on his professional career. He is close with his colleagues and also had a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">working wife</a>, Diane Macedo, his past co-anchor in World News Now. But outside of his professional life, he doesn’t seem to be linked with anyone romantically and is not married.</p><h2>Does Kendis Gibson have a Wife?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The 48 years old anchor is known to be very active. He likes working out and hiking either alone or with colleagues. In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram post</a>, Diane Macedo, an anchor at ABC, posted a picture while enjoying nature with Gibson mentioning him as a 'work husband'. They worked together in World News Now when Gibson still was in ABC. Going through Diane’s social media account, she seems to be married and has a son.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There is no report of Gibson dating or having a girlfriend in the past. He is not married yet and doesn’t have a wife either. The journalist seems to be focused on his career and enjoying his single life at the moment.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>There Have Been Speculations that Gibson Might be Gay</h2><p>Gibson is dad to a miniature schnauzer named Tito together with a man named <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">George Brown</a>.

This left fans of the anchor with speculations that he might be gay. The fact that Gibson doesn’t have a girlfriend and isn’t married might have also raised suspicions about his sexuality. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Gibson being gay only seems to be speculations as he has not given any confirmation about his sexuality.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The journalist also mentioned his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interest</a> in&nbsp;The Pandemic, The Polls & Inclusion, a discussion that outlined&nbsp;Supreme Court cases that will affect the LGBTQIA+ community.</p><h2>The Anchor is&nbsp;Thriving as a Journalist Who Wants to Use His Position to Represent the Good of his Country</h2><p>From reporting deadly navy yard shooting to covering the devastating Santa Barbara oil spill, multiple severe storms, and the shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer in South Carolina, Gibson has delivered various serious news. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Formerly, Gibson anchored “America This Morning” and “World News Now” on ABC News.&nbsp;Currently, he works as a live <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">weekend anchor</a> for MSNBC (since January 2020).</p><p>According to a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">bio</a> on ABC News, before joining ABC, Gibson had spent time at local and national networks.
