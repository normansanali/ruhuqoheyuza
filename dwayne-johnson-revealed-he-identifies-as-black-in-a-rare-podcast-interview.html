His father was black, while his mother identified as Samoan. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This brought up a debate online</a> about fans questioning Dwayne Johnson's race. One fan tweeted out that Dwayne identified as Samoan during his rise in WWE.</p><p>:Cool, he identifies as Samoan in WWE and was booked that way after Nation days. Was never booked, proclaimed, or titled as First black champion. And hardcore wrestling fans don't name him as such as well. Thus nobody calls him a black champion. Anoa'i family background angle."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Dwayne Johnson Sent Hollywood A Message By Firing His Entire Team, And He Was Completely Right</a></span></p><p>Surprisingly, back in 2019, DJ actually took the time to response, clearing up the question.</p><p>“Glad I came across this and I’ll give you guys some context & truth. I identify as exactly what I am – both. Equally proud. Black/Samoan,” Johnson tweeted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“And my friend, let me expand your thoughts a bit here – I transcended race in wrestling so there was no ‘booked that way.' Thx guys.”</p><p>Credit to Johnson for taking the time and answering the question.

DJ also took the time to discuss if he faced discrimination early on because of his race and ethnicity.</p><p>Johnson said on the podcast, "Discrimination, yes, growing up. I lived in the south, at that time, I was a 70s baby, in those areas, in the world of wrestling, your wrestling in small towns, living in trailer parks. And kids are looking at me like, what are you? Are you Mexican, black, something? So yea, that happened."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The moment takes place at the 25:00 minute mark.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Dwayne Johnson Regretted Turning Down A Massive Franchise Film Worth $1 Billion That Went To Mark Wahlberg</a></span></p><p>DJ also discussed his tough childhood, especially alongside his father. Johnson revealed that his biggest goal back then was simple, and that was just not to go broke.</p><p>The podcast interview was a rare on for DJ and it already has over one million views. Fans also praised the topics of discussion during the interview.</p><p>One fan writes, "Man I’m glad they talked about depression and mental health. The rock is one of my biggest inspirations to improve myself and knowing that even a guy that seems like Superman to me also had bouts of depression."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fan continues, "If you’re suffering, just know that there are people that love and care about you even though it seems like nobody does because they don’t say it. But the most important thing is that you love yourself. I haven’t found that yet but I hope I do and others going through dark times can find their way too."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Dwayne Johnson's Interaction With Keanu Reeves Was Everything Fans Hoped It Would Be</a></span></p><p>Clearly, The Rock has an impact on millions and should consider more podcast interviews in the future.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-claims-he-was-mistaken-as-a-female-during-ages-7-to-11>Dwayne Johnson Claims He Was Mistaken As A Female During Ages 7 To 11</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar50850657.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only was DJ constantly asked about his race, but it turns out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was often times labeled as a female during the ages of 7 to 11</a>. Johnson detailed that due to his appearance, the confusion typically took place during his youth.</p><p>"I sit down next to a kid, and within 60 seconds, he goes, 'Can I ask you something? I said, 'Yeah.' He goes, 'Are you a boy or a girl?'"</p><p>"I would say between the ages of 7 and 11, people thought that I was a little girl because I had really soft features and I had really soft Afro hair."</p><p>It clearly was quite the childhood for Dwayne Johnson growing up, and fans can get a closer look at what his life was like in his NBC series, Young Rock.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibsJmpo7Juts6hpaynnmK%2FpsLEmqOenF2dsm61w56lraGWnrK0ecCsZJukkZi4brXNZphmqpGnsm68zp2amqukYravwMSrraKdp2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emma-stone-new-trailer-kinds-of-kindness-details.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emma Stone squares up to Joe Alwyn in Kinds of Kindness movie trailer - watch</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./daniella-gibbs-leger-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-349841-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Daniella Gibbs Leger Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biograph</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
