But according to the queen herself, she's dated very few men. So how many boyfriends has Beyoncé had? Apparently fewer than three.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Why Beyoncé Rarely Does Live Interviews And Submits Her Own Personal Essays Instead">Why Beyoncé Rarely Does Live Interviews And Submits Her Own Personal Essays Instead</a></span></p><p>Beyoncé did state she only had one boyfriend before Jay, but it seems entirely plausible that she has only ever dated two men. Though plenty of rumors have cropped up over the years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tying the songstress to names like Sisqo</a>, Pharrell, and even Kobe Bryant and Justin Timberlake, those were never confirmed.</p><p>The two relationships that have been confirmed? Lyndall Locke between 1993 and 2000, and Jay-Z from 2000 onward. The timeline, though, may not be quite what it seems.</p><h2 id=did-beyonc-eacute-dump-her-high-school-sweetheart-for-her-career>Did Beyoncé Dump Her High School Sweetheart For Her Career?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Beyoncé doesn't often speak out about her personal relationships (well, outside of her songs), Lyndall <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Locke claimed in an in-depth interview with Daily Mail</a> that he and Bey got together when she was 12 years old (he is two years older). He also revealed they had their first kiss (at a Brian McNight concert) the following year.</p><p>In the same interview, Locke claimed that the two were together for ten years. He marked their breakup in the year 2003, when Beyoncé began to mention Jay-Z, "casually dropping his name."</p><p>The only problem with the timeline? Most sources report that Bey and Jay have been together since 2000.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="According To Jay-Z, This Is What He And Beyoncé Do During Their Spare Time">According To Jay-Z, This Is What He And Beyoncé Do During Their Spare Time</a></span></p><p>Of course, Knowles herself said that she and Jay-Z met in 2000 (in Mexico) but didn't have a date until a year and a half later. Depending on what month their first date was in (internet sleuths don't seem to have uncovered that detail. Yet?), that likely means her two relationships overlapped. According to Locke, they definitely did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only that, but Bey's dive into the entertainment world with Destiny's Child's initial hits meant she was even more focused on her career and upward rise. Locke, in contrast, was at home doing not much of anything — except waiting on Bey to send him tickets to her shows, according to his mom.</p><h2 id=beyonc-eacute-39-s-ex-says-he-cheated-on-her-but-she-left-him-for-jay-z>Beyoncé's Ex Says He Cheated On Her, But She Left Him For Jay-Z</h2><p>In his tell-all interview, Lyndall admitted that he cheated on Beyoncé early on in their relationship; he was 15, she was 13, and Locke had his first intimate experience with someone else.</p><p>Locke does suggest that he cheated on Beyoncé simply because he felt that she was away all the time and he was "lonely." They did break up as young teens but later reconciled, according to Lyndall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But he'd make the same mistake again later on, when Beyoncé was on the road — and the two were much older. Looking back, he seems to think he shouldn't have been surprised when Beyoncé began edging him out of her life, due to more than just her fame.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Does Beyoncé Spend Her $500 Million Fortune On?">What Does Beyoncé Spend Her $500 Million Fortune On?</a></span></p><p>Along with name-dropping Jay-Z, Locke said that Beyoncé's family (her team) seemed to be closing him out, and he also realized that he and his first love were on different paths in life. He also noted that Knowles' dad (who personally orchestrated her career, according to Locke) and her powerhouse mom seemed to look down on him, the 'small town kid,' while their daughter was becoming a superstar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And Beyoncé's seeming ticket to the big leagues? A rapper by the name of Jay-Z. Locke had plenty of negative things to say about his time with Bey, though he doesn't outright talk smack on her, but he did say that his then-girlfriend told him Jay-Z wasn't her type, but that they should 'take a break.'</p><p>Not long after, according to Locke's timeline, Bey and Jay were the next Hollywood power couple, and he was left behind once again.</p><p>These days, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Locke owns his own catering business</a>, has a child, and is happily paired up with his child's mother. Not that Beyoncé seems very interested. Clearly, she's been busy since breaking things off with her high school sweetheart!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Beyoncé's Insane Work Ethic, Explained ">Beyoncé's Insane Work Ethic, Explained</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnrGfo7CmecWiqaysXZe8urLRopynnF2Ytaat056bZquYmnqtscWtZKGhnWK3osXZaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./billie-eilish-admits-she-used-a-doppelganger-at-coachella-524938.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Billie Eilish admits she used a doppelgnger at Coachella</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aaliyah-kikumoto-parents-charles-and-a-j.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Aaliyah Kikumoto | Parents Charles and A.J</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
