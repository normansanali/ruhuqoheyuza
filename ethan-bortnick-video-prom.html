Ethan unleashes his angst and frustration at how his life has reached a dead end so quickly.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>There’s the aggravation of his stalled love life (“we never went on a date”), thanks to circumstances beyond his control (“quarantine made sure that I was too late”). There’s self-loathing at not being on the same level as his peers (“how did the hell did I end up in my parents’ house / everybody my age has already moved out”). With astute lyrics about how life can easily go off the rails, “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>prom</a>” is a perfect coming-of-age anthem for those still waiting for it to happen – or are worried that it already did, and they missed it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ethan-Bortnick-embed1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ethan-Bortnick-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>prom</a>” video is quite significant to Ethan, beyond the meaning in the song’s lyrics. “Traveling to LA used to be normal to me. It started with my first appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno when I was six, but this last trip to LA to film the music video for ‘prom’ felt very different,” he tells <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. “I was going to LA to finally fully execute my vision as an artist both visually and musically. Thanks to the incredible production team, the music video highlights the things I missed out on during quarantine in a really colorful yet tragic way. Having not traveled for two and a half years, this music video trip felt like the happy ending to ‘prom,’ finally getting out of the house and doing what I love again.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Ethan will also host a “prom” afterparty in &nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rec Room</a> – the virtual world, games, and user-generated content platform with 60M players. Tomorrow, April 30 from 11 a.m. PDT, anyone who joins Rec Room can go to prom with Ethan Bortnick as he performs the track as his in-game avatar, greets fans, and watches the “Prom” music video together. All event attendees will receive a special prom-themed t-shirt for their avatars.</p><a title=@ethanbortnick href=# rel=nofollow>@ethanbortnick</a><p id=content-paragraph-6>THANK U THANK U THANK U I LOVE U GUYS I CRYING SO MUCH IF U KEEP STREAMING ILL NEVER SLEEP THO</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><a title="♬ cut my fingers off - Ethan Bortnick" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ cut my fingers off – Ethan Bortnick</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Ethan has been finding a way to do what he loves, despite all the obstacles life has thrown his way over the past two years. Known by many for his viral hit “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cut My Fingers Off</a>” and the boundless charm on his TikTok page, <span>Ethan – now 21 – has been walking this music path as soon as he learned to walk. A classically trained pianist who first discovered his talent when he was age three, Ethan holds the Guinness World Record for World’s Youngest Solo Musician to Headline His Own Concert Tour. Though he honed his chops in classical and jazz, Ethan felt there was more to his sound.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In 2020, Ethan released his debut ep, harmonic minor. Now, he’s signed to Columbia Records and ready to take his career to the next level. No more missed opportunities. No more regrets. Now, the entire world is Ethan’s prom, and he will dance until the last song plays.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5FyZp6smJa7bq7Oq6unoZOgere1w56mZqiipLpw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./golden-car-dealership-agrees-to-pay-935k-after-discriminating-against-women.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Golden car dealership agrees to pay $935K after discriminating against women</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./billie-eilish-admits-she-used-a-doppelganger-at-coachella-524938.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Billie Eilish admits she used a doppelgnger at Coachella</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
