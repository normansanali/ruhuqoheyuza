It attracts visitors from all over the country and offers a variety of rides, shows, and attractions. If you’re planning a visit to Dollywood and want to avoid the crowds, it’s important to pick the right day of the week.

However, it’s worth noting that even on weekdays, Dollywood can still attract a significant number of visitors, especially during peak seasons.</p><h3><span id=FAQs_about_Dollywood8217s_least_crowded_days>FAQs about Dollywood’s least crowded days</span></h3><h3><span id=Q_Are_weekends_always_crowded_at_Dollywood>Q: Are weekends always crowded at Dollywood?</span></h3><p>Weekends at Dollywood tend to be busier compared to weekdays, especially during peak seasons.
