If she were ever to come to life though, Bo-Katan actress <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katee Sackhoff</a></strong> from The Mandalorian thinks she knows exactly who should play her.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>The Star Wars universe is continuing to expand. Ever since Lucasfilm was bought by Disney it has been churning out content, with its best-performing series so far being The Mandalorian. One of the stars of the show, Sackhoff, plays Mandalorian royalty Bo-Katan Kryze, and, if the last name didn’t already give it away, she is, in fact, the sister of Satine Kryze. The two didn’t always see eye to eye, with Satine promoting peace, distancing herself from her people’s warrior past.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>We wouldn’t have seen Satine in The Mandalorian given the timeline. Unfortunately, Satine is killed in The Clone Wars series by Darth Maul who was seeking revenge against Obi-Wan Kenobi, Satine’s love. This event took place well before the events in the hit Disney Plus series, but if any show were created that looks back at that timeline, Sackhoff has a good idea about who should play her sister in a live action.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bo_Katan_Kryze.jpg><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>Speaking on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Varley Show</a>, the actress responded to a question about what they thought of having Obi-Wan Kenobi as a brother-in-law in a hypothetical timeline, saying,</p><p>“I’ve definitely questioned who Bo knows. Like, who does Bo know in this world? What does Obi-Wan mean to her? What has happened to them in the past? Who is he to her now? All of those questions go through my mind. And I don’t know.”</p><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>In regards to who could ever play the character, the actress has a particular name in mind,</p><p>“I’m sure Dave (Filoni) has all the answers to all of this stuff. That’s the cool thing about Filoni is that he already has all the answers to all of this stuff. It’s just a matter of whether or not I get to be privy to it or not… I wish that we could talk about Satine. I think Cate Blanchett would be amazing.”</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>Indeed the Australian actress certainly has a striking face that could match up to the character design somewhat from the animated series. It isn’t that likely that we will see a live-action version of her character though, given that Satine died a long time ago. Though fans have been clamoring for some live-action content from this time period, it seems it isn’t really on the cards for now.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>Perhaps we can get a flashback to the character and see Obi-Wan still struggling with his loss <a href=#>i</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">n a second season of Obi-Wan Kenobi, if that ever gets the green light</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBqbGMppinnJGhvLO1wKdkm6ddoK61rc1mmJysn6d6tLTAq5ysZZiav268yJyiZp6fp3q4tM5mqqGnpaGxbrzLmrBmq5Gptq%2BxjKSpsrKVYravecuirZ5lkZjBqrvNaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./samsung-galaxy-note-2-review-t-mobile.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Using a 'Phablet' - Samsung Galaxy Note 2 Review (T-Mobile)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1079af5e0f.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Abductors (1972) - Flickchart</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
