Although the police initially treated it as a missing person case, the discovery of the child’s body at a nearby irrigation pond turned the case on its head. Investigation Discovery’s ‘See No Evil: Someone You Trust’ chronicles the heinous murder and follows the investigation that depended heavily on CCTV footage to bring the perpetrator to justice. Let’s delve into the details surrounding the murder and find out more, shall we?</p><h2>How Did Sandra Cantu Die?</h2><p>A resident of Tracy, California, Sandra was just eight at the time of her murder. Like any other typical kid her age, she was close to her family and the light of her mother’s life. Although Sandra’s parents had separated and she had not seen her father for years, he too appeared to care for her and was devastated when she went missing. People who knew the eight-year-old mentioned that apart from being a brilliant student, she loved hanging out with her friends and had dreams about her future. Sadly, she had no idea that a crime fueled by hatred would end her aspirations forever.</p><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=659892 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/sandra-cantu-murder-where-is-melissa-huckaby-now/screenshot_8-247/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_8-3.jpg data-orig-size=1142,583 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=Screenshot_8 data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_8-3.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_8-3.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_8-3.jpg alt width=1024 height=523 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>On March 27, 2009, Sandra returned as usual from school and went out to play at a friend’s house. Nevertheless, she soon returned home before telling her mother she would go to another friend’s place in the evening. Since all the families lived in the same neighborhood, Sandra’s mother got dinner ready before asking the eight-year-old’s brother, Thomas, to call her back home. Yet, he couldn’t find her anywhere.</p><p>As soon as Thomas returned home with his news, Sandra’s eldest sister, Simone, and their mother, Maria, went out to comb through the nearby areas. Still, there was no news about the missing child, and the anxious family eventually reported her missing to the police. The search for Sandra continued for days, and the police left no stone unturned. Yet, as the days rolled on, the eight-year-old’s family began fearing the worst.</p><p>Eventually, the fear was confirmed when authorities discovered a suitcase dumped inside an irrigation pond on April 6, 2009. Inside the suitcase, the cops found Sandra’s deceased body, and an initial medical examination indicated asphyxiation. Later, an autopsy confirmed that the child was beaten mercilessly and sexually abused before the killer gave her Xanax and smothered her to death.</p><h2>Who Killed Sandra Cantu?</h2><p>While the brutal nature of the crime shocked the cops, they found the initial investigation to be challenging as the suitcase, and the irrigation pond did not provide a lot of leads. Furthermore, since Sandra was just eight and her mother had no known enemies, people had no idea why the family would be targeted this way. Nevertheless, when talking to the victim’s family, the police found that they had installed a camera on their front porch shortly before the murder.</p><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=659894 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/sandra-cantu-murder-where-is-melissa-huckaby-now/screenshot_9-217/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_9-4.jpg data-orig-size=1139,638 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=Screenshot_9 data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_9-4.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_9-4.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_9-4.jpg alt width=1024 height=574 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Although officers sifted through hours of footage captured through this camera, they only found Sandra walking out of the frame and had no idea what had happened to her. Interestingly, her mother, Maria, told the police that Melissa Huckaby, a local Sunday school teacher, had texted her on the day the eight-year-old went missing, claiming she had something stolen.</p><p>The latter also approached the police during Sandra’s funeral and mentioned she found a note which said the victim’s body was inside a suitcase that had been disposed of in the water near Bacchetti Road and Whitehall Road. Though the note seemed suspicious enough, the police had no idea why Melissa was the one who received it. However, further information soon appeared once the cops canvassed the area around the irrigation pool. While asking around, a witness approached the police and <a href=#>claimed</a> he had seen a purple SUV near the pond on the day Sandra went missing.</p><p>While the vehicle’s presence was strange in itself, the witness also met a female who had hurried out of the woods nearby, claiming she had to stop her car to pee. The CCTV footage in front of Sandra’s house determined that the purple SUV belonged to Melissa Huckaby. Besides, the witness could identify the suspect from the video. Hence, without wasting time, the police arrested Melissa before charging her with murder.</p><h2>Where Is Melissa Huckaby Now?</h2><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=659895 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/sandra-cantu-murder-where-is-melissa-huckaby-now/screenshot_10-178/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_10-2.jpg data-orig-size=1137,642 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=Screenshot_10 data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_10-2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_10-2.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot_10-2.jpg alt width=600 height=339 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>When presented in court, Melissa initially pled not guilty to the charges against her and chose to undergo a jury trial. Albeit, midway through the proceedings, she accepted a plea deal and pled guilty to a count each of first-degree murder and kidnapping. As a result, the additional charges, including rape with a foreign object and poisoning, were <a href=#>dropped</a>. Eventually, in 2010, the judge sentenced Melissa to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She currently remains incarcerated at the Central California Women’s Facility in Chowchilla.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwqrrEppihp5yesG%2BvzqZmrJmemb%2BiecKapa2tXaLCs7DEq2SwoJWnsm610maknqSZqMCieceumqSZkq56r7vWaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-lancaster.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Lancaster, Actress, Husband, Body &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nokia-announces-white-lumia-800.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nokia Announces White Lumia 800</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
