You can’t have it both ways.”</p><p>The actress continued, “In Hollywood, who you’re dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show or an act. For me, it’s the difference between being able to have a life and not. If someone takes a photograph of me and posts it, within two seconds they’ve created a marker of exactly where I am within 10 meters. They can see what I’m wearing and who I’m with; I just can’t give that tracking data.”</p><p>Two years later, however, Harry Potter’s <a href=#><strong>Rupert Grint</strong> </a>hinted that things between Watson and Felton might have been <a href=#>a little more than platonic</a>. “There was always something,” Grint, who played Ron Weasley in all eight movies, told Entertainment Tonight in November 2019. “There was a little bit of a spark. … We were kids. It was like any kind of playground romance … I didn’t have any sparks. I was spark-free.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Brown University graduate has been linked to celebrities including <a href=#><strong>Chord Overstreet</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a> throughout her career, which skyrocketed in 2001 thanks to her role as Hermione Granger in the movie adaptation of <a href=#><strong>J.K. Rowling</strong></a>’s beloved book series. But in her December 2019 British Vogue cover story, Watson opened up about her most important relationship: <a href=#>the one she has with herself</a>.</p><p>“If you have not built a home, if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby, and you are turning 30, and you’re not in some incredibly secure, stable place in your career … There’s just an incredible amount of anxiety,” she told the outlet. “I never believed the whole ‘I’m happy single’ spiel. It took me a long time, but I’m very happy [being single]. I call it being self-partnered.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see everyone Watson has romanced — or has been rumored to have romanced — in the past!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksq65wGaumqyjpLu0ecOaq6Kml2K1qr%2FTqKmyZaCntq%2BvxGafmqqirnqktM6rm2anppq%2FtMDRnpytZZ2kv6Z70aiZnqqkpHqis9SiqZ5n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gillian-millane-mother-of-british-backpacker-grace-millane-murdered-in-new-zealand-breaks-her-silence-over-daughters-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gillian Millane, mother of British backpacker Grace Millane murdered in New Zealand, breaks her sile</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ashley-walters-bio-age-wife-songs-movies-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ashley Walters Bio, Age, Wife, Songs, Movies, TV Shows And Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
