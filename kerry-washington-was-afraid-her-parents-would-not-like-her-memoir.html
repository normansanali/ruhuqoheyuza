The <a href=#>Emmy Award winner</a>, 46, learned the truth just as her signature TV series, Scandal, ended in 2018 after six years. “We went into family therapy together for a little while,” Washington told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles Times</a> in a profile published on Monday, September 25. “We really just started engaging with each other with a lot more transparency and directness and honesty. “<p>“I had been thrown into this new journey of who I am and what I believe in, in just everything about how my life had turned out,” the actress added. “I had a hard time writing about it then.”</p><p>Washington and her husband, former NFL star <strong>Nnamdi Asomugha,</strong> have two children together, daughter Isabelle, 9, and son Caleb, who turns 7 in October. She is also stepmom of Asomugha’s teenage daughter from a previous relationship.</p><p>The couple are very protective of their personal lives. They have never shared photos of their kids, and Washington has not revealed the name of her stepdaughter.</p><p>“I have been private about my personal life and very protective of my children, but my parents have always been a part of my public narrative. And so suddenly, when I got this new information, I felt like a fraud,” Washington commented. “I felt like if I wasn’t telling the truth about my parents, I was going to perpetuate a lie. I didn’t want to hide from my story, and if the story was going to be out in some way, I wanted to be in charge of my story.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kerry-Washington-Was-Afraid-Her-Parents-Would-Not-Like-Her-Memoir-inline.jpg><p>Thicker Than Water was published Tuesday, September 26.</p><p>“The biggest hurdle was handing it to my parents,” Washington told the outlet. “Once they read it, once they gave me their blessing, I felt like I’m OK.</p>In the book, Washington writes about the lack of connection she felt with her parents, as well as her <a href=#>panic attacks</a>, sexual trauma and body image issues.<p>She explained that people who have read the book share with her what they have been hiding about their own lives.</p><p>“They tell me their secret. There is healing in the sharing of secrets, in the shedding of that shame,” Washington said. “There’s so much opportunity for community and I feel so seen, because when somebody shares their vulnerability with me, to me that is a signal that they have really seen me and in seeing my vulnerability they feel safe to share.”</p>During a separate interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>NPR</a>, Washington got into more detail of learning about the sperm donor at the age of 41.<p>“My parents shared with me that my dad — my beloved dad — is not my biological father,” Washington said. &nbsp;“I was born from a sperm donor, at a time in the ’70s where … it was considered risky and important to remain secret. “I didn’t grow up feeling that kind of deep emotional transparency and intimacy with my mother. But looking back, I think, ‘How could I have?’ She was keeping a secret from me that she could not reveal.”</p><p>Since the sperm donor revelation, Washington’s relationship with her father has evolved.</p><p>“One of the things that occurred to me when I learned this truth [of my biological father] is that every time I’ve ever told my dad that I love him, it has always been on the condition of a lie,” she recalled to NPR. “And so consciously or unconsciously, there must have been some part of him that thought, ‘She loves me because she thinks I am her dad.’ … And I have now gotten the opportunity to love my dad unconditionally, and he has had the opportunity to feel what it feels like to be loved in vulnerability. … I can’t even begin to articulate the value of that in our relationship and in our family.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKeqqKuerit0qGgp5%2BkpLtuw8CsZJqeopa2pXnHnqlmqJGnsq%2FA0mauqK2cmXqvu9Nmo6KjlWK1pr6Mppymp5mnfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kubota-m4000.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kubota M4000 Specs, Price, Review, Serial Numbers 2022</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ja-morant.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ja Morant - Bio, Age, Height, Single, Net Worth, Facts, Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
