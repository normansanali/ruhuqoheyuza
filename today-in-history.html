Sent by France to teach Western war tactics to Japanese soldiers, Brunet eventually joined the fight against imperialist forces in Japan. Shogunate forces, which had ruled Japan since the 11th century, began fighting against imperialist Emperor Meiji and his modernization efforts in the mid-1800s. Brunet, who was in Japan at this time, chose to fight for the shogunate.</p><p>He would later flee to France after suffering a decisive defeat by the imperialists and remain a wanted man in Japan for years. Later, the Japanese government would pardon Brunet and even award him medals, including the Order of the Rising Sun, and a popular blockbuster called <a href=# rel=noopener>‘The Last Samurai’</a> would immortalize his story.</p><h2>1839: Louis Daguerre Takes The First Known Photo Of The Moon</h2><p>French photographer and inventor Louis Daguerre, creator of the daguerreotype photographic process, uses this method to take the first known photo of Earth’s moon. Unfortunately, Daguerre’s laboratory burned down just two months later, destroying his records and the image of the moon. The next year, John W.
