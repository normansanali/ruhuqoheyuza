When the awards show returned from a commercial break, a curtain raised on a darkened stage with two shadowed figures emerging: Quavo and Offset, standing before an image of the Space Shuttle. As a recording of Takeoff's verse on the song "Hotel Lobby" began (as recorded by his duo with Quavo, Unc & Phew), the space shuttle took off and the pair launched into the group's biggest hit, "Bad & Boujee."</span></p><p><span>ET talked to Offset and Quavo backstage after their performance, where they reacted to their surprise spot on the BET stage. "We pull it together, rocket power," Quavo said. Offset noted that the performance meant "everything" to them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Both Offset and Quavo have shared several tributes to Takeoff since his death almost a year ago.&nbsp;Takeoff -- whose real name was Kirshnik Khari Ball -- was&nbsp;28 when he was killed at a bowling alley when an argument led to gunfire.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Two weeks after Takeoff's death, Offset&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel>broke his silence</a><span>&nbsp;and called the tragedy a "nightmare." Offset took to Instagram and said, "The pain you have left me with is so unbearable. My heart is shattered and I have so many things to say, but I can't find the words."</span></p><p><span>Offset, only two years older than the close friend </span><a href=# rel>he regularly called his cousin</a><span>, said he had been going to sleep and waking up hoping it was all a dream, but instead, "it's reality, and reality feels like a nightmare."</span></p><p><span>The rapper's heartbreaking tribute continued, "I wish I could hug&nbsp;you one last time. Laugh one last time. Smoke one last time. Perform one last time."</span></p><p><span>In April, Offset took to Instagram to&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel>reveal a massive back tattoo honoring Takeoff</a><span>. The tattoo depicts&nbsp;Takeoff in space while wearing a tiger-print coat and a handful of chains around his neck. Offset kept the caption simple but sweet: "Love you 4L & after."</span></p><p><span>Quavo, who is actually Takeoff's uncle although he's only three years older,&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel>released the heartbreaking single "Without You"</a><span> in January, just two months after Takeoff was killed.</span></p><p><span>The rapper was with Takeoff at the time of his death, and in&nbsp;the touching new track, he&nbsp;raps about how he's struggled since Takeoff's death.&nbsp;"Tears rolling down my eyes. Can't tell you how many times I cried. Days ain't the same without you. I don't know if I'm the same without you," he raps.&nbsp;"I wish I had a time machine just so you can take a ride with me. But I know it don't work that way and I'mma see you again someday."</span></p><p><span>The&nbsp;Georgia rapper performed the single </span><a href=# rel>during&nbsp;the emotional&nbsp;In Memoriam segment</a><span> at the&nbsp;</span><a href=#>2023&nbsp;GRAMMY Awards</a><span>, where he was joined by the gospel group Maverick City Music. After the moving performance, Quavo remained on stage holding Takeoff's chain to the sky well into the next segment as the curtain came down.</span></p><p><span>In that same month, Quavo broke his silence about his nephew's death.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"This whole time I’ve been trying to figure what you really are to me because nephew wasn’t it," he wrote in part on Instagram. "We hated that word 'nephew’ or when they said 'Unc and Phew’ cuz we always knew we were closer than that and it made me feel old too. But I knew you weren’t my brother cuz you are my sister’s son, so I couldn’t say brother. Now I finally get it… you are OUR angel."</span></p><p><span>He released </span><a href=# rel>his&nbsp;second song dedicated to his late nephew</a><span> in February,&nbsp;announcing the drop just hours before its release and unveiling its official cover art as well as a link to its accompanying video on Instagram.&nbsp;The visual features footage of Quavo at an "undisclosed location," surrounded by his&nbsp;impressive jewelry collection,&nbsp;playing basketball with his famous friends&nbsp;and flaunting his fleet of luxury cars. Although he's clearly proud of his success, the rapper says that he would give it all away "just to see my dawg just one more time."</span></p><p><span>"Tryin' to move forward, but I don't got all the answers," Quavo raps on the record. "But I know I can't look backwards, that's dangerous/I had to go read the Bible and take a few pages."</span></p><p><span>Patrick Xavier Clark, who was arrested and charged for Takeoff's murder on Dec. 2, 2022,&nbsp;has been indicted by a grand jury on a murder charge.</span></p><p><span>Be sure to keep up with&nbsp;</span><a href=#>ET's winner's list</a><span>&nbsp;throughout the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>RELATED CONTENT:</span></strong></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>BET Awards</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>2023 BET Awards: The Complete Winners List</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Offset Debuts Massive Back Tattoo Honoring Late Cousin Takeoff</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>Music</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Quavo Pays Tribute to Takeoff in 'Greatness' Video: 'Take Did That'</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>Grammys</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>2023 GRAMMYs Pay Tribute to Christine McVie, Takeoff and Others</span></h3></a><p class=label>Video</p><a class=title href=#>GRAMMYs: Quavo Performs Emotional Tribute to Takeoff</a>Related Photos<a href=# aria-label="2023 BET Awards Red Carpet Arrivals"><span class=slidecount>15 Photos</span></a><a href=# aria-label="2023 BET Awards Red Carpet Arrivals"><span>2023 BET Awards Red Carpet Arrivals</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7psDOp6OippVjsLC5jqagoKejYrynstKeq2aZnpl6ssHAr6ZmqpWqu6rAxGarqGWYpLuwvoylmK2dXamurLHOn51mr5mptW6%2F1Kunq6GjmnpzfJFsZJudpGKuuK3RnapmqJWns7C%2BzJqlnJ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./optic-midnite-net-worth-175186.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>OpTic MiDNiTE Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brooklyn-rose-orton.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Brooklyn Rose Orton Photos of Randy Ortons Daughter with Wife Kim Marie Kessler</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp;
