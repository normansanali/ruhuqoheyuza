According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, a r<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">emake of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</a> is currently in the works, starring Josh Gad. The Frozen actor is in talks to play Wayne Szalinski's (Rick Moranis) grown-up son Nick, who becomes a scientist and accidentally shrinks his kids.&nbsp;</p><p>If you remember, the 1989 film followed a similar premise and saw Wayne's kids and their two neighbors' children having to fight their way back to safety through the backyard — which included bugs, lawnmowers, and the family's dog —&nbsp;after they were accidentally shrunk down to the size of less than an inch and thrown out in the trash.</p><p>After 30 years, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, is still a movie classic. In honor of the reported reboot, take a look back at where the original cast of the film is today.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Rick Moranis (Wayne Szalinski)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney/Getty</span></figure><p>Rick Moranis played nerdy science dad, Wayne Szalinkski, who accidentally shrunk his kids. The 66-year-old actor reprised his role in the sequels that followed. Since Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Rick took a break from the business to focus on his family. His most recent acting credit is from 2018 when he guest-starred on an episode of The Goldbergs.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Marcia Strassman (Diane Szalinski)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney/Getty</span></figure><p>After playing the role of Diane Szalinski in the Honey, I Shrunk franchise, Marcia Strassman continued to star in numerous TV shows and films. Unfortunately, the actor lost her battle with breast cancer and passed away in 2014. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Thomas Wilson Brown (Russ Thompson Jr.)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney/Instagram</span></figure><p>Who could forget the dreamy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas Wilson Brown</a> —&nbsp;aka Little Russ Thompson —&nbsp;who had a crush on his next-door neighbor, Amy? After his starring role in the iconic '80s comedy, Thomas continues to act, and his recent credits include numerous shorts and guest roles on TV series.&nbsp;</p><p>The 46-year-old actor also settled down and is currently married with kids of his own.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Robert Oliveri (Nick Szalinski)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney</span></figure><p>No one could forget how Nick Szalinski was almost eaten by his dad when he accidentally fell into a bowl of Cheerios while trying to get his attention. After his first starring role in a feature film, the child star continued his career with the role of Kevin in Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Robert ended his show biz career in 1994, we'll never forget his ending line: "Hey wait!

Jared Rushton (Ron Thompson)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney/Facebook</span></figure><p>Remember, it was next-door neighbor Ron Thompson's baseball that activated the shrink ray gun, which shrunk all of the kids. Jared Rushton starred as the devious Ron, who seemingly always had a comeback to every comment. A memorable line in the film was when Ron shouts: "Earthquake!" Though, we all know there was NO earthquake...</p><p>Besides his role in the late '80s film, Jared is also known for starring alongside Tom Hanks in Big and in Overboard with Goldie&nbsp;Hawn and Kurt Russell. After ending his acting career in 2000, Jared shifted his focus to music and performed in the band <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deal by Dusk</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7.
