She also met with <strong>Sara Affoue Amani</strong>, the ambassador from the Ivory Coast.</p><p>In the photo, the queen wears her signature pearls, a blue-and-green floral printed dress and a large diamond brooch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Queen-Elizabeth-II-Zooms-in-From-Windsor-Castle-for-an-Ambassador-Meeting.jpg><p>The occasion marks the first time the queen has been pictured carrying out her royal duties since her husband, <a href=#>Prince Philip</a>, <a href=#>died on April 9</a> at age 99. She <a href=#>attended her first royal engagement</a> following his death on April 13, but no photographs were released to the public.</p><p>According to <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a>, the queen has been using video chats to communicate with her family members over the past year. “Both my grandparents Zoom,” he said on <a href=#>The Late Late Show With James Corden</a> in March. “We’ve Zoomed them a few times, they’ve seen <a href=#>Archie</a> running around.”</p><p>He also shared a cute story about the way the late Duke of Edinburgh would sign off from his calls. “My grandfather, instead of, like, pressing, ‘Leave meeting,’ he just goes, ‘Doof,'” Harry joked, imitating the sound of someone slamming a laptop shut. “I’m like, ‘OK, bye!'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Queen-Elizabeth-II-Zooms-in-From-Windsor-Castle-for-an-Ambassador-Meeting-2.jpg><p>Though the queen is still coping with the loss of her partner of more than 73 years, other members of the royal family have <a href=#>praised her ability to keep carrying out her duties</a>. “The queen has been amazing,” <strong>Sophie, the Countess of Wessex</strong>, told The Sun earlier this month, adding that the monarch has been “thinking of others before herself.” The countess, 56, is married to the queen’s youngest son, <strong>Prince Edward</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s been a bit of a shock,” the Earl of Wessex, 57, added in the same interview. “However much one tries to prepare oneself for something like this it’s still a dreadful shock. And we’re still trying to come to terms with that. And it’s very, very sad.”</p><p>Philip had been in poor health for a while, undergoing heart surgery earlier this year and <a href=#>spending one month in the hospital</a>, but royal expert <strong>Ingrid Seward</strong> told Us that the queen was <a href=#>likely still surprised</a> by her husband’s death.</p><p>“Although it was expected, although he was so old, it still would have been a shock,” the Prince Philip Revealed author explained. “Shock makes you go into … what I always call military mode, because you actually do things very, very calmly, very exactly, very quickly, and you just get on with it. And usually, grief hits a little bit later. So I would think that the queen is absolutely just getting on with the organization or delegating her wishes as to what she wants … I think when the whole thing is over, that will be the hard time for her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaqrZWau26xy6KxmpqVqbVutchmpJ6dpKh6orqMmqSbmaOorqW70WapnqWfqbKtxYyvoJplpp6xpruMnJ%2BarF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./snowbird-brown.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Snowbird Brown Dating, Boyfriend, Rumor, Pregnant, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./oliver-mccall.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Oliver McCall</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
