She began her professional journey of the actor after an agent approaches her for acting.&nbsp;</p><p>The agent was captivated by her fabulous acting in the drama that <strong>Kristen</strong> had played during her primary school during the <i>Christmas</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>She was only eight when she started acting and giving the audience for <i>Hollywood</i> movies. She enters the <i>Hollywood</i> from her small role in ‘<i>The Thirteenth Year</i>‘ film.</p><p><strong>Kristen</strong> got her first breakthrough in <i>2008</i> from the movie “<i>Twilight</i>” and its series.&nbsp;</p><p>Her role of <strong>Bella Swan</strong> and her intimate relationship with vegetarian vampire <strong>Edward Cullen</strong> in the film is successful in gaining worldwide fans.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of rising fame from the movie, <strong>Kristen</strong> became the highest-paid actress in the world in <i>2010</i> and <i>2012</i>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wanted-to-be-married></span>Wanted to be married<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It is hard to say either <strong>Dana</strong> is married or not as he is secretive about his personal life, including marriage and relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>However, about her sister <strong>Kristen</strong> we can share some information. <strong>Kristen</strong> is not married yet but wanted to get married soon.&nbsp;</p><p>It is not hidden from the public that <strong>Kristen</strong> is famous for her varied multiple relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>She has dated not only men but also women. <strong>Michael Angarano, Robert Pattinson, Lane Garrison</strong> were some men she dated.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, <strong>Alicia Cargile, Soko, Stella Maxwell, Sara Dinkin </strong>were some girls she was in a relationship.

She is a <i>screenwriter</i> of different films such as <i>Loose Ends, XOXO</i>, and TV shows such as <i>Miss 2059</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>In <i>April 2019</i>, the short movie ‘<i>Rock Bottom</i>‘ has created the buzz among the audience.&nbsp;</p><p>She has even splashed her skill as a actor in movies such as <i>Death and Return of Superman, Wrestling isn’t Wrestling</i>, etc. movies.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=no-confirmation-regarding-wedding></span>No confirmation regarding wedding<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There is not any information regarding the wedding of <strong>Dana</strong> as well as of his sister too.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kristen</strong> shared last year that she is desperate to purpose her girlfriend, <strong>Dylan</strong>, but there is still no information to confirm either their wedding is going to happen or not.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple first meets each other in a movie set. Then the couple did not meet for six years.&nbsp;</p><p>But again, when they see each other at their best friend’s birthday party, a spark flew between them. After that, they started seeing each other.&nbsp;</p><p>After two weeks of their dating, <strong>Kristen</strong> expressed her love toward her, and since then, they were together.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=stays-with-siblings-after-fame></span>Stays with siblings after fame<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Dana</strong> has three siblings altogether. <strong>Cameron Stewart</strong> and <strong>Taylor Stewart </strong>are his two brothers apart from his sister <strong>Kristen</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Taylor </strong>and <strong>Dana</strong> are not the biological brother of <strong>Kristen</strong> and are adopted by her parents. Siblings are very precious to <strong>Kristen</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>As per hello magazine, although she became prosperous and famous, she prefers to stay with her brother in her family’s home <i>Woodland Hills</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>She is so tied up with her brothers that she feels weird to live on her own without her brothers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-inspiration-for-acting-from-parents></span>The inspiration for acting from Parents&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Dana</strong>‘s parents are from the entertainment industry on which father, <strong>John Stewart</strong>, is a level <i>manager and TV producer</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, his mother, <strong>Jules Mann-Stewart</strong>, is a famous <i>Australian script supervisor</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>When <strong>Kristen</strong> was younger, she did not want to be an actor; instead was attracted to be the camera grip like her brother.&nbsp;</p><p>But as her parents are from the entertainment industry, they inspired her to do acting and try her luck in the film industry.&nbsp;</p><p>And her parent’s suggestion became a miracle for <strong>Kristen</strong>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The net worth of <strong>Dana</strong> is not available.
