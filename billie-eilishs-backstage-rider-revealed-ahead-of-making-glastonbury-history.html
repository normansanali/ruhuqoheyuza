I would say that that’s a good thing for the most part.”</p><p>Despite kicking off the biggest weekend in music, Billie is unable to hang around as she has more gigs in London this weekend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000175190692.jpg><p>However, that doesn’t mean she won’t be checking out the sights of Worthy Farm ahead of her set.</p><p>During her recent appearance at Coachella Festival in California, Billie used one of her dancers as a double so she could go under the radar.</p><p>She admitted: “‘I had a body double, one of my dancers. We got a black wig and we put buns in and we gave her a mask and sunglasses.</p><p>“Everybody thought it was me. I put on a big black coat and a traffic vest, hood, and glasses.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>SURPREZRA!</h2><p>FRESH from topping the album charts, George Ezra is gearing up for a secret set at Glastonbury after getting FOMO about not being there.</p><p>The Green Green Grass singer will be one of several acts, including Bastille and Paolo Nutini, who will pop up for surprise performances this weekend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/tp-composite-glastonbury-1.jpg><p>I’ve learned George arranged a last-minute set after the line-up was announced because he was so jealous of everyone else getting to play.</p><p>Talking to The Sun in April, when doubts were clearly creeping in, he said: “The thing about the Glastonbury line-up is, it’s something I concern myself with until I’m actually there.</p><p>“And when I’m there, I’m like, ‘Just stick me on in any tent, I’ll come and play in somebody’s tent. I just want to be there’.</p><p>“I’m gutted to be missing Glastonbury this year, genuinely.</p><p>“That’s another thing I do, I kid myself like, ‘Oh I’m used to festivals now because I work them, I don’t need to go for myself’.</p><p>“Then the promo starts and you start hearing interviews from people who are going and you’re like, ‘Oh f***, I’m going to miss that’.”</p><p>Now I can confirm he will make a surprise appearance on the John Peel stage on Sunday – so he won’t actually have to play in anyone’s tent.</p><p>But I wouldn’t be surprised if that happens too.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>BALL NOT COMING OUT FOR DIANA ROSS</h2><p>ZOE Ball will swerve Diana Ross’ set.</p><p>The BBC Radio 2 host admits she would rather watch it on TV in favour of catching Irish punk-rock band Fontaines D.C.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/e917f5c8-d65a-49b4-9960-b78fdb3a210d.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000742328522.jpg><p>Diana will follow in the footsteps of Kylie Minogue and Dolly Parton and play the legends slot on Sunday on the Pyramid Stage.</p><p>Zoe said: “Oh Fontaines D.C.! I fricking love them, I love them! All the way! I can watch Diana Ross on telly when I get home.”</p><p>The weekend promises to be a family affair for the former party girl as her son Woody Cook made his Glastonbury debut last night on the Greenpeace stage.</p><p>Meanwhile, ex-husband Fatboy Slim will also be on site playing the Sonic stage this evening.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>GRIFF SET TO MAKE A SPLASH</h2><p>RISING star Griff is keen to make her first Glastonbury one to remember.</p><p>The Black Hole singer, who recently supported Dua Lipa on her European tour, told me she has splashed out on a luxury teepee to camp in following her spot on the John Peel Stage today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/0062997d-c60f-4fd3-ac91-3a2a85dfd83c.jpg><p>Griff told me: “After my set I am going to get to be a punter, which I have never done at a festival. I have a teepee.</p><p>“I am staying for a few days. I have brought a couple of friends and we are going to chill.</p><p>“Everyone has been hyping it up to me so I thought as I’m playing I’ve got to do it. I’m not too scared of camping so I will be all right.”</p><p>If she needs to know the hotspots, she’s should ask Dua.</p><p>In 2019 the New Rules singer partied until 3am in the very kinky onsite club NYC Downlow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/38ac46bf-ef30-4b68-a18d-fbee1501af45.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/baa84584-bc39-484d-97fd-0cda5d7090be.jpg><p>This year the venue has some of the biggest names in dance music playing, including Honey Dijon, who is rumoured to have worked on Beyonce’s upcoming album.</p><p>Of course, I would never partake in such debauchery but rumour has it NYC Downlow is the place to be.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>GLASTO-WONDERLAND</h2><p>WHEN Alice went down the Rabbit Hole she was invited to her Unbirthday.</p><p>So it seems only right that the Lewis Carol-inspired hidden area The Rabbit Hole at Glastonbury should pull out all the stops for the festival’s 50th Un-Birthday.</p><p>Organisers were forced to scrap plans for a 50th anniversary weekend in 2020 due to the pandemic.</p><img decoding=async alt="Woman with big boobs trolled for 'flaunting them' but insists she's just 'existing'" width=295 height=188 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/COMP-KS-CURVY-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async alt="UK's luckiest street revealed as 19 neighbours scoop 'life-changing' lotto wins" width=295 height=188 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/RM-lottery-comp.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Keen to keep the party going around the clock, Frank Sinatra’s granddaughter AJ Lambert will take to the secret stage this evening at 3am.</p><p>Tomorrow Dermot O’Leary will also play a celeb-packed DJ set at 2am.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OvqqGnp5e2u3vBoqOloZVisqq4yKyfrGWSlrCsv9Oanp5lop6xpr6Mq5yvnZGhsqV5wKGcmpxdpLNuucCkoKefXZy5or%2FTqKWbraKueqm10q2mq7Ff</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./darcey-stacey-darcey-silva-calls-georgi-rusevs-chat-with-jesse-meester-a-slap-in-the-face-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Darcey Silva Calls Georgi Rusev's Chat With Jesse Meester a 'Slap in the Face'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bessy-gatto.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bessy Gatto- Meet Seven Years Of Wife, American Comedian Joe Gatto</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
