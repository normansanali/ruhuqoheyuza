As a result, it didn't take a lot of fans by surprise when the couple ultimately tied the knot even though things could be tumultuous between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No matter how good something may seem at times from the outside looking in, however, things can be very different behind closed doors. Based on what Miley has said in the past, it appears that <a href=#>her relationship with Liam behind the scenes was a disaster</a>.</p><p>For that reason, it seems like it was only a matter of time before Miley and Liam got divorced. Still, it is fascinating to look back at how Liam and Miley's relationship started and realize how different things were for the couple when they first got involved.</p><h2 id=the-history-of-miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth-39-s-relationship>The History Of Miley Cyrus And Liam Hemsworth's Relationship</h2><p>In Hollywood, the vast majority of people who make it are extremely good-looking, to say the least. With that in mind, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that there are many examples of <a href=#>co-stars becoming a couple on set only to later break up</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth-in-the-last-song.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2009, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth met on the set of a movie called The Last Song which went on to perform well at the box office. While The Last Song has mostly been forgotten since it was released, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the relationship that Liam and Miley went on to have</a> certainly still garners headlines to this day.</p><p>In 2010, Miley and Liam appeared at a red carpet-event together for the first time. After taking that major step forward, Liam and Miley were spotted together many times in the weeks that followed.</p><p>Despite it seeming like their relationship was on good footing, Miley and Liam then went through a period where they split up and got back together many times. In 2012, it seemed like all of that was over when the couple got engaged, but they split again in 2013.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Times Miley Cyrus Mentioned Liam Hemsworth In Her Songs</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Liam and Miley reunited, they got engaged again and in December 2018 the couple walked down the aisle together. After their wedding day, Miley went on talk about being "so happy" during interviews and Miley told Vanity Fair that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">losing their home brought them closer together</a>.</p><p>“I would say that losing the house changed us much more than getting married changed us,” she said. “When you experience what we experienced together with someone, it is like glue. You’re the only two people in the world who can understand.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth-on-the-red-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miley continued, “I’m not sure without losing Malibu, we would’ve been ready to take this step or ever even gotten married, who can say? But the timing felt right and I go with my heart. No one is promised the next day, or the next, so I try to be ‘in the now’ as much as possible.”</p><p>Ultimately, the couple's marriage ended in divorce only months after Miley made those remarks.</p><h2 id=what-was-so-different-about-miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth-39-s-relationship-at-first>What Was So Different About Miley Cyrus And Liam Hemsworth's Relationship At First?</h2><p>In January 2023, Miley Cyrus' first single off her album Endless Summer Vacation was released. Just like many of Miley's singles from the past, "Flowers" went on to be a huge hit for Miley and Columbia Records. In fact, it could easily be argued that "Flowers" was one of the most talked about songs in years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Miley Cyrus Set Up 'Flowers' To Start Controversy?</a></span></p><p>Once "Flowers" became a huge hit, virtually everyone wanted to know if the song is about Liam Hemsworth. While Miley didn't bother to confirm that "Flowers" was about her ex-husband, many articles were written explaining <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why the song seemed to be about Liam</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Elle's article about "Flowers", the publication pointed out several reasons to think the song is about Liam. First of which, fans noticed that "Flowers" was released on Liam's 33rd birthday, and it seemed very unlikely that was a coincidence.</p><p>On top of the timing of "Flowers'" release, fans found it impossible to not read into the song's lyrics. The reason for that is several of "Flowers" lyrics seemed to reference things that are known about Miley's relationship with Liam.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth-paparazzi-photo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By far the most obvious lyric that nodded at Liam was “We were right 'til we weren't / Built a home and watched it burn”. For those that don't know, Miley and Liam shared a Malibu home that was destroyed in the Woolsey fire.</p><p>Some of Miley's other lyrics from "Flowers" appear to point to reports about Liam and Miley's relationship. For example, there were reports that Miley wanted to fight to save their marriage and that she felt like Liam wanted her to act differently and the song's lyrics touch on those themes.</p><p>There also are unconfirmed reports that "Flowers" lyrics refer to a Bruno Mars song that Liam played at their wedding. Finally, there is a theory that the suit Miley wears in the music video for "Flowers" calls back to a red carpet event where Liam reportedly told Cyrus to behave.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus Blames Her Divorce From Liam Hemsworth On One Thing</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the day, it certainly hasn't been confirmed that "Flowers" is about Miley's relationship with Liam but that does seem all but certain. On top of that, it is worth noting that Miley has spoken about her relationship with Liam and how it ended in many interviews.</p><p>Back when Miley and Liam's relationship was just beginning, there was a lot of interest in rumors they were a couple. While speaking to Seventeen in 2009, the interviewer tried to get Miley to speak about dating Liam.</p><p>Now that Miley is so open about her relationship with Liam, her comments in that interview are amazing. The reason for that is Miley told the interviewer that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and Liam agreed not to talk about their relationship</a> in public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It sucks when your personal life becomes public. So I'm finding ways to make my personal and private life more of my life -- which is one of the reasons why I deleted my Twitter. We've decided that any type of relationship that we have, we will always just keep it very DL. First and foremost, we are best friends, so that's what I tell people all the time."</p><p>To see a couple go from not wanting to even admit they are together to telling all during interviews and almost certainly writing songs about their relationship is an incredible turnaround.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikoqSVrnqkxdGuqmagpaivorrDZqOimZ1itaa50rCmq6yYYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnPrpmloZNir7OxwKSsqWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./skillibeng-age-and-real-name-how-old-is-he.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Skillibeng Age And Real Name: How Old Is He?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-ealy-parents-facts-to-know-about-his-family-452318-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Ealy Parents: Facts To Know About His Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
