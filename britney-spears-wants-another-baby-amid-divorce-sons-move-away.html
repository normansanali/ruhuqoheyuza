However, it seems that the Crossroads star is not heeding their advice.</p><p>“Her assistants don’t want [Paul] around; they’ve made that clear from day one,” the second source went on. “She is such a sweetheart and generous by nature, but he doesn’t want anything. He isn’t in it for that and genuinely cares about her as a person.
