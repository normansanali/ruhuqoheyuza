The altercation was prompted by a jab from Rock at Smith’s wife, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jada Pinkett Smith</a></strong>, aimed at her recent hair loss. The discussion around who was in the right was ongoing for weeks following the event, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh news about the Smiths</a> is once again throwing the famous couple into the spotlight.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>The Oscars drama, paired with news that Pinkett Smith and her husband <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have been separated</a> for more than half a decade, quickly prompted a slew of questions about Pinkett Smith and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">medical condition</a> surrounding her hair loss. It also brought up questions about the 50-year-old actress in general as people dig up details to bolster their arguments.</p><h2 id=h-jada-pinkett-smith-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>Jada Pinkett Smith’s net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Pinkett_Smith.jpg><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>Pinkett Smith and her husband are not strangers to the limelight. They’ve both enjoyed impressive genre-spanning careers for several decades and their famous family is often at the center of Hollywood gossip. The last several years have seen additional chatter arise surrounding the family’s typically genteel image after Pinkett Smith admitted to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">having an affair</a> with the much younger August Alsina during a separation from Smith. News of the affair promptly went viral, sparking a debate of its own.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Apart from the affair, however, and a few controversies surrounding their parenting style, the Smiths mostly maintain their status as one of Hollywood’s tamest families. They’ve enjoyed a far longer marriage than most of their famous peers, sharing nearly 25 years together despite recent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revelations of a lengthy separation</a>.</p><p data-characters=580 data-current-count=918 data-injectable=true>Smith’s name is slightly better known than that of his wife, but Pinkett Smith remains a linchpin of Hollywood nonetheless. She’s mostly stepped back from film in recent years, instead dedicating much of her time to her talk show, Red Table Talk. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The award-winning series</a> follows three generations of Pinkett Smith’s family, from her mother — Adrienne Banfield-Norris — down to Pinkett Smith and her daughter, Willow Smith and aims to provide “a forum where the perspectives of three different generations on a wide variety of topics are shared.”</p><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>Pinkett Smith’s focus on her talk show hasn’t entirely robbed her of the chance to participate in films, either. She still found time in her busy schedule to appear in 2021’s The Matrix Resurrections along with several roles in television programs. Pinkett Smith is still a heavy hitter in the world of Hollywood, and that prominence is reflected in her net worth. She doesn’t share an income with her husband, however ⏤ a fact that is clear when examining the pair’s ballooning bank accounts over the years.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>Pinkett Smith has a net worth of around $50 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. This is more than $300 million less than her husband, but is still an enviable number by all accounts. Pinkett Smith accumulated her wealth over years of acting in film and television projects as well as work in music videos, fashion, and as a writer of children’s books.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZqWsaJ5z6KlpJ2kqXq0ucitn6xlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-brooke-schofield-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Brooke Schofield?
