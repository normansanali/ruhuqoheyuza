They've been together quite some time, but that doesn't mean that they don't have their fair share of problems. Already, we've seen them butt heads over communication.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But that's clearly not their only issue at hand.</p><p>In an exclusive clip of Love During Lockup obtained by Distractify (see above) ahead of the July 28 episode, we learn about another potential problem in their marriage. You see, Chris is actually fairly wealthy and there is concern that he may be trying to buy Jade's love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/v1T0LujY1/200x200/kelly-corbett-headshot-kelly-corbett-1632841187031.jpg><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chris has allegedly spent over $1 million on wife Jade from prison.</h2><p>In an exclusive clip of Love During Lockup, Jade is seen driving in the car with her sister Jess, who isn't the biggest fan of Chris.</p><p>They discuss some of the issues in Jade and Chris's relationship, to which Jess points out that Chris sometimes buys Jade big-ticket items after they get into big fights. "Is he like trying to buy your love?" she asks Jade.</p><p>Jade lists some of the purchases Chris has made for her, which include but are not limited to a $570,000 house, a $60,000 truck, a $34,000 side-by-side ATV, and a camper that cost between $50,000 to $60,000.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In an aside, Jess says: "From prison, Chris is spending over a million dollars on my sister easily."</p><p>She continues: "I mean Jade isn't like a materialistic person, but also it's kind of nice having all this stuff thrown at you. I think the money helps a lot in this situation."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where did Chris Chipps get all this money?</h2><p>Chris is believed to be part Native American. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, there is a Chris Chipps who is an enrolled member of the Prairie Island Indian Community.</p><p>If you do a little research into this community, you'll find that it is a Mdewakanton Sioux Native American reservation in Goodhue County, Minn. It's unclear how wealthy their reservation is, but a different Mdewakanton reservation in Minnesota has made numerous headlines over the years and has even been called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“the richest tribe in America”</a> thanks to its ownership of the Mystic Lake Casino Hotel and Little Six Casino.</p><p>That said, it's likely that Chris and his family may have a lot of money to their name.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Watch new episodes of Love During Lockup on Fridays at 9 p.m. ET on WE tv.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWztdJmqqmdnql6cnnMoqOloZ%2BjerC6jKOYnZ1doby3sYydrKuhnpx6rbvCpKyp</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-holster-weapon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Holster Weapon in Cyberpunk 2077</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bryan-lourd-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bryan Lourd Net Worth How Much is Lourd Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
