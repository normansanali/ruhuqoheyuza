In a surprisingly candid interview with Radio Times, Hanks described himself as "a total idiot" for making a major health mistake that ultimately caused the star to be <span data-rel=noopener data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/trigger-finger-diabetes-news/ data-target=_blank>diagnosed with diabetes</span>. Read on to learn which poor health habit the actor now deeply regrets, and how he surprised fans by following doctor's orders.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Cancer Survivor Rita Wilson Says She Stopped Eating This After Her Diagnosis</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tom-Hanks-1.jpg><p>Appearing on the Late Show with David Letterman in 2013, Hanks said the news of his diabetes came as a big surprise—though it arguably should have come as no surprise at all. "I went to the doctor, and he said, 'You know those high blood sugar numbers you've been dealing with since you were 36? Well, you've graduated! <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>You've got type 2 diabetes</a>, young man,'" Hanks recounted.</p><p>Up until then, the Sleepless in Seattle star had made only modest attempts to <span data-rel=noopener data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/how-to-prevent-diabetes/ data-target=_blank>slow the progression</span> of his pre-diabetes through his diet. "<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>I thought I could avoid it</a> by removing the buns from my cheeseburgers," he told Radio Times. "Well, it takes a little bit more than that."</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:&nbsp;<span data-rel=noopener data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/eye-floaters-diabetes-news/ data-target=_blank>If You See Eye Floaters, It Could Be a Sign of This Chronic Condition</span>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tom-Hanks-Rita-Wilson-2-1.jpg><p>Hanks says his health habits were an indisputable cause of his <span data-rel=noopener data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/mold-in-toilet-diabetes-news/ data-target=_blank>rising blood sugar levels</span>. "I'm part of the lazy American generation that has blindly kept dancing through the party and now finds ourselves with a malady," the actor told Radio Times. "I was heavy. You've seen me in movies, you know what I looked like. I was a total idiot."</p><p>Experts advise that if, like Hanks, you are diagnosed as pre-diabetic, losing between five and 10 percent of your body weight may help to reverse the course of your illness. In fact, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine, doing so can lower your risk of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>developing type 2 diabetes</a> by 58 percent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tom-Hanks-Rita-Wilson-1.jpg><p>Hanks says that despite the seriousness of his diagnosis, his doctor was optimistic that change was possible—but only if the actor made sweeping changes to his health habits. "My doctor says if I can hit a target weight, I will not have type 2 diabetes anymore," Hanks told Letterman in 2013.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>However, the Splash star was skeptical that he could make significant enough changes to reverse his illness at the time. "I'm going to have <span data-rel=noopener data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/diabetes-superfoods-news/ data-target=_blank>type 2 diabetes</span> then, because there is no way I can weigh [what I weighed] in high school," he said, laughing.</p><p><strong>For more health news sent directly to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Tom-Hanks-2.jpg><p>Since that interview, it seems the Forrest Gump actor has had a change of heart. No longer accepting his diabetes as inevitable, he now says he works diligently to maintain a healthy weight and keep his blood sugar levels in check. "I try to get, every single day, one hour of activity. That can be anything from a treadmill or a walk or a hike with a dog, but it has to be <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>one hour every single day</a>," he told <strong>Phoebe Robinson</strong> on the podcast Sooo Many White Guys in 2018. "I watch what I eat to a point of boredom, and every now and then I cheat to the point of self loathing," he added, noting that he blames his diagnosis both on genes and "the horrible lifestyle I led of eating anything."</p><p>It appears, however, that all his hard work has paid off. While hitting the red carpet in Cannes for a screening of his new film, Elvis, fans noticed that Hanks was <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>more slender than ever</a>. Though managing weight is just one facet of diabetes management, for Hanks, it's big a step in the right direction.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>If You See This on Your Nails, It Could Be a Tell-Tale Sign of Diabetes</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmraedYrWiusqsZJ2hkZeytbHSZqWer6Nk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andrea-subotic-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andrea Subotic - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tessa-netting.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tessa Netting Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
