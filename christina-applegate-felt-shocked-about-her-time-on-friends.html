In the years since then, Applegate has opened up about her time on Friends, and it's safe to say that her experience was in line with what other stars have reported.</p><h2 id=christina-applegate-had-a-great-time-while-filming-friends-and-was-quot-shocked-quot-by-her-emmy-nomination>Christina Applegate Had A Great Time While Filming Friends, And Was "Shocked" By Her Emmy Nomination</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/christina-applegate-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being a guest star on a show can be tough for a performer, especially when that show is Friends. Thankfully, Christina Applegate, a savvy and seasoned TV performer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had a great time while filming the show</a>.</p><p>Applegate was dynamic on the show, and even won an Emmy for her performance.</p><p>"It was shocking that I was nominated for the episodes I did because it honestly didn't feel like work. And it didn't feel like I was doing anything special in any way. I was just having so much fun. I really was in shock when that happened. It was one of those moments of, like, 'why … what, me?' Like in Sixteen Candles when she's like 'Me?' And he's like, 'Yeah, you.' That's how I felt when they said my name," the actress said.</p><p>This is great to hear, and like Applegate, the show featured other guest stars who had nothing but positive things to say about their experience on set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing that certainly helped was having a longstanding friendships with certain cast members.</p><p>"I've known Matthew Perry since we were kids. We did a movie called ‘Dance Until Dawn’ together when we were little babies. But I've known him for 100 years.
