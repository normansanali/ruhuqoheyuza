In 2000, the former mayor of Manila banned the distribution of contraceptives in city-funded health centers, which lasted nearly a decade.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the Guttmacher Institute</a>, the result is that half of all pregnancies in the predominantly Catholic country are unintended, with 90 percent of those unintended pregnancies due to lack of access to contraceptives.</p><p>Before Manila's crowded and impoverished reality, some politicians have tried to remedy the situation. For instance, in 2012, former President Benigno Aquino III signed a reproductive health bill into law, which required government-sponsored health care centers to distribute free birth control.</p><p>However, religious groups came out in droves against the law and questioned its constitutionality. Ultimately, in 2014, the Supreme Court largely upheld the law, but placed a temporary ban on contraceptive implants as they viewed they might cause abortions.</p><p>In January of this year, the government struck another blow to the law's potential by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cutting funding to the free contraceptives program</a>. Just this month, the Supreme Court decided to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">extend the ban</a> to two forms of implantable contraception.</p><p>Roughly 80 percent of Filipinos identify as Catholic, a religion with deeply entrenched legal and cultural mores. Indeed, abortion is illegal in the country -- as is divorce.</p><p>As a result, maternity wards are so crowded that expectant mothers must share single beds, and the infant mortality rate thus remains high enough to help place the Philippines in just about the top third of all countries worldwide.</p><p>Once they make it to adulthood, many Manila residents, forced to live in squalor face countless health problems. For all his recent controversies, current President Rodrigo Duterte seems to want to take on this problem -- which to him means confronting the Catholic Church head-on.</p><p>"I will reinstall the program of family planning. Three's enough," he told the Associated Press in June. "I've also been colliding with the church because [its stance is] no longer realistic."</p><p>It remains to be seen what will come of Duterte's Catholic Church collision course. In the meantime, the photos above perhaps do the best job of explaining why dramatic action is needed.</p><p>For more extreme places, be sure to check out <a href=#>pollution in India</a> and <a href=#>China</a>, as well as what life looks like in the <a href=#>Danakil Depression, known as "hell on Earth."</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyttcWeZKKmo56xpnnMmqWipJE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./802441-loe-shimmy-wizz-havinn-zuper-hip-hop-news.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Loe Shimmy &amp;amp; Wizz Havinn Rep Florida ON &amp;quot;Zuper&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./liam-hemsworth-movies-and-tv-shows-a-guide-to-his-best-roles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Liam Hemsworth Movies and TV Shows: A Guide to His Best Roles</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
