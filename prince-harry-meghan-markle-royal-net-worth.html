Meghan's past career as an actress helped boost the duo's wealth, as <a class=hm-link href=#>her time on&nbsp;Suits</a> brought her a reported $50,000 per episode.&nbsp;</p><p id=efJMmTb-Nk_ data-wc=60>Harry also made an annual income from <a class=hm-link href=#>his career in the army</a>, and despite the fact that he had to give up his military titles when he left royal life in 2020, it's possible some of the couple's wealth derives from this also. Without a doubt however, the couple's wealth today is mostly bolstered by their more recent business ventures.</p><h2 data-gid=e3_LZnoCyUzI>Where does Meghan and Harry's money come from in 2023?</h2><p id=edJ_yEEcAp data-wc=58>Seeing as Meghan has retired from acting, Harry has retired from the army, and both have retired from royal life, you may find yourself wondering where they get their impressive fortune from now - beyond their savings. The answer lies mostly in the new work which the pair have taken on since moving to <a class=hm-link href=#>their $14.7 Montecito home</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/b7dacaaf1882-meghan-and-harry-gold-dress.jpg><p id=e1vxD-A5zvr data-wc=45>For example, <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry's memoir&nbsp;Spare</a> sold over 1.4 million copies on its release day, and reportedly made the Prince several million in advance before it was even written. In September 2020, the couple signed <a class=hm-link href=#>a $100 million contract</a> for five years with Netflix too.&nbsp;</p><p id=exdieTh_GR data-wc=47>Less than three months later, Harry and Meghan also signed <a class=hm-link href=#>a contact with Spotify</a> for three years. There were conflicting reports about how much this contract was worth, but it appears it was in the realm of $15-25 million. The deal <a class=hm-link href=#>came to an end</a> in 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9dc7ed2eddd8-meghan-markle-diana-ring.jpg><p id=eNXq-z88pL data-wc=80>In December 2022, Harry and Meghan's first Netflix project, <a class=hm-link href=#>their docuseries&nbsp;Harry & Meghan</a>, was released.

According to reports, she received around $50,000 per episode. Her annual pay cheque is estimated to have come in around $450,000, including her brand endorsements.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/a81f82bc66c4-meghan-markle-wedding-flowers.jpg><p id=ezK7LEoK5qF data-wc=59>Meghan also appeared in several films, including and Her role in earned her $187,000, while earned her $171,000. The Duchess also released a clothing line for Reitmans which quickly sold out. As a result, her net worth in 2017 was valued at around $5 million, or £3.9 million.</p><h2>Who did Prince Harry inherit money from?</h2><p id=etaJeLL5D4 data-wc=37>It is unknown whether Harry inherited any money from his grandmother, <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, on <a class=hm-link href=#>her death in September 2022</a>. It is believed, however, that he did inherit money from his great-grandmother <a class=hm-link href=#>the Queen Mother</a> in 2002.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/a69a9bffbe2d-gettyimages-1209005122.jpg><p id=eiy_rAzF1P data-wc=48>Both Harry and <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince William</a> were the inheritors of the majority of their mother <a class=hm-link href=#>Diana the Princess of Wales</a>' estate, after <a class=hm-link href=#>her tragic death</a> in 1997. This is believed to have totaled around £13 million ($16.5 million). The brothers are also thought to have received her jewelry collection.</p><p id=eY5umIUSFqZ data-wc=65>Prior to their marriage, Harry revealed that he had Meghan's ring <a class=hm-link href=#>made with diamonds from his mum's collection</a>, saying: "The ring is obviously yellow gold because that's her favorite, and the main stone itself I sourced from Botswana.
