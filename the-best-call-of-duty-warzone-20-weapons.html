There are some clear winners that carry over from <a href=#>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</a>, but there are other top-tier weapons that might surprise you in battle royale. Of course, the weapon meta constantly shifts as Activision updates the way firearms perform, so we’ll make sure to keep this up to date with each new patch.</p><p>These are the best Warzone 2.0 weapons for Season 4, categorized by weapon type. Keep in mind, some categories will be skipped, as they don’t have any viable — let alone meta — options at the moment.</p><h2>Assault rifles</h2><h3>Chimera</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><p>When it comes to midrange sniper support weapons, few weapons compete with the Chimera. Although this is in the assault rifle category, it functions more like an SMG, with an extremely fast time to kill (TTK) up close.</p><h3>Kastov 74u</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The Kastov 74u is a lot like the Chimera in terms of functionality, excelling as a sniper support or mid-range rifle. Although this weapon is a bit easier to control than the Chimera, making it a solid option for newcomers. It hits almost as hard, too.</p><h3>Lachmann 556</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In terms of long-range rifles, the Lachmann 556 is at the top of its class, as it’s extremely easy to use. It doesn’t hit as hard as some of the heavier LMGs, but thanks to its ease of use, you shouldn’t have any trouble hitting your shots from afar.</p><h3>TAQ-56</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Even after a slight meta shift, the TAQ-56 is still one of the best assault rifles in the game. It’s easy to use, has very little recoil and kick, offers a competitive TTK, and includes very clean iron sights, saving you a weapon attachment slot. This weapon has a lot going for it, as it’s a versatile, practical choice in the Assault Rifle category.</p><h2>SMGs</h2><h3>ISO 45</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The new ISO 45 is easily a top contended up-close. It has one of the fastest close-range TTKs and competes with many of the other sniper support weapons at mid-range. The main thing to be aware of is the small mag size of 45, which can be tough to manage in trios or quads.</p><h3>Lachmann Sub</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>For a more practical option, we recommend the Lachmann Sub (essentially the MP5). This weapon has comparable TTKs to the Fennec and a slower rate of fire, meaning it’s a little less forgiving, but it won’t blow through ammo as quickly. The Lachmann has plenty of power and even works well at midrange, making it a versatile option. It’s a little harder to use than the Fennec, but if you plan on playing Trios or Quads, the Lachmann is the way to go. This will likely be a much more practical choice for most players.</p><h2>Shotguns</h2><h3>KV Broadside</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As much as it pains us to include this Shotgun on our list, we cannot overlook the sheer power of the KV Broadside — particularly with the Dragon’s Breath rounds. Full-stop, it needs to be nerfed, but until then, you might as well give it a try. This weapon is devastating up close, and is capable of downing an enemy in just a couple of shots, depending on how close you are. But with the Dragon’s Breath rounds, you’ll deal fire damage for a short period afterward, making you practically unstoppable up close. Enjoy this while it lasts, because it will no doubt get nerfed.</p><h2>LMGs</h2><h3>HCR</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The HCR has been slept on for a while, but now that some of the other meta weapons have received nerfs, this LMG can shine. It’s not as heavy as some of the other LMGs, functioning more like an assault rifle, while still retaining a fast TTK and relative ease of use.</p><h3>RAAL MG</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The RAAL MG is technically more powerful than the RPK, offering better TTKs in most situations. It’s dominant up close, at midrange, and even from afar, with faster bullet velocity than the RPK. However, this weapon feels much slower in nearly every way, which could make the difference between winning and losing a gunfight. It has sluggish ADS speed, reload times, sprint-to-fire speed, and overall mobility, so it definitely has its downsides. However, once you actually connect with your shots, this weapon is absurdly good.</p><h3>RAPP H</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The RAPP H is easily one of the best LMGs in terms of TTK, though it can feel a bit unwieldy. If you can learn to master the recoil, you’ll absolutely fry the competition with this weapon. Just make sure to time your reloads appropriately.</p><h2>Sniper Rifles</h2><h3>FJX Imperium</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As long as you equip explosive rounds and aim for the head, the FJX Imperium can earn one-hit kills in Warzone. It’s certainly harder to use than other rifles, but if you’re consistent at earning headshots, you’ll enjoy using this weapon.</p><h3>Signal 50</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Since snipers do not earn a one-hit elimination (even to the head), many of them are not as viable in Warzone 2.0. However, the Signal 50 is still highly usable, specifically because of its fire rate. Thanks to its high power and fire rate, you can quickly pull off follow-up shots to secure fast eliminations. By default, the Signal 50 deals around 234 damage to the head (according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TrueGameData</a>), meaning it’ll take two shots to down a fully-plated enemy.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfnK6utc2gZq2glWKvpr%2FTZpqapJxivKd5w66rsmWnlr%2B7u82eZGtoXayyorzOp6po</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./guy-fieri-kids.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>When Guy Fieri Isn't Eating His Way Around America, He's a Dad to Two Kids</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./person-stabbed-outside-kowloon-restaurant-in-saugus-ma.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tragic Incident in Saugus: Person Stabbed Outside Kowloon Restaurant in Saugus, MA</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
