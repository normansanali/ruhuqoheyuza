One social media user <a href=#>responded</a> to the ’90s rock band, “You had one hit in a children’s movie about ogres. She has eight albums spanning three genres and worldwide recognition. U are not the same.”</p><p>Another fan of the “Reputation” artist <a href=#>tweeted</a>, “Not one hit wonders who are living off the split royalities from a song that was featured on a movie soundtrack made for CHILDREN speaking…your rent is past due pls worry about that.”</p><p>Swift announced the surprise release of her <a href=#>eighth studio album</a> on Thursday, July 23, and penned a thoughtful note to her fans about the meaning behind the folk-inspired songs the next day.</p><p>“It started with imagery,” she shared on Twitter on Friday morning. “I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I’ve never met, people I’ve never known, or those I wish I hadn’t. … In isolation, my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness.”</p><p>As fans tuned into the 16 brand new tracks, some shared their theories about the hidden clues within the lyrics. While some listeners believed Swift <a href=#>revealed the name</a>&nbsp;of <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Blake Lively</strong></a>‘s third child, who was born in October 2019, others wondered whether or not the “Gorgeous” songstress also sent a message to her ex <a href=#><strong>Joe Jonas</strong></a>.</p><p>“Cold was the steel of my axe to grind / For the boys who broke my heart / Now I send their babies presents,” Swift sings on “Invisible Strings,” which several fans <a href=#>believed to reference Jonas</a>, 30, who is expecting his first child with wife <a href=#><strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Swift and the DNCE singer dated from July to October in 2008, and at the time, the “Blank Space” singer was left burned by their breakup.</p><p>“[Joe] is not in my life anymore, unfortunately,” Swift revealed during a November 2008 interview on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. “Someday I’m gonna find someone really, really great who’s right for me. When I find that person that is right for me … And when I that person, I’m not even gonna be able to remember the boy who <a href=#>broke up with me over the phone</a> in 25 seconds when I was 18.”</p><p>The Grammy winner has since moved on with <a href=#>boyfriend <strong>Joe Alwyn</strong></a>, who she began dating in May 2017. Earlier this year, a source told Us Weekly exclusively that the couple “have talked about their future and marriage” and are still “very much in love.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqmmaOdeq671K2fZquYlrGmv4ytmLKkn6d6tMPIn6usZZ6axG651KygnGWUrrmiuoyomauhlaN6s7HSqaannKNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stephen-curry-james-hardens-contract-extensions-worth-dwyane-wade-made-entire-career.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stephen Curry And James Harden's Contract Extensions Are Worth More Than Dwyane Wade Has Made During</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mark-goddard-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mark Goddard Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
