Lisa has remained at the opulent Star Island estate with the children.</p><h2 class=split>Animosity between exes since divorce filing</h2><p>In her Season 5 tagline, 'The Real Housewives of Miami' star Lisa Hochstein sends a warning to her estranged husband: "You can try to take my castle, but you will never steal my crown." The 40-year-old Housewife is divorcing her 50-year-old spouse Lenny Hochstein in the new season of Peacock's 'RHOM' revival, who filed for divorce in May 2022 after 12 years of marriage and weeks of rumors.</p><p>"Lisa and I are getting divorced," he told Page Six. Logan, 7, and Elle, 3, are the couple's two children. Since the revelation, Lisa and Lenny's relationship has devolved into public spats over their children, their lavish $52 million Miami mansion, and Lenny's new girlfriend. Sadly for Lenny, but fortunately for viewers, it was all caught on Peacock cameras, which means the upcoming season of 'RHOM' will show their marriage's dissolution from both of their views.</p><p>Lenny told Page Six that the pair "contemplated divorce for the last several years" before he filed for divorce. "I tried my best to avoid it for the sake of our children, who we love deeply," he added. "We have been living separate lives for months and made the decision to divorce last month." The physician also verified claims that he began dating model Katharina Mazepa after they divorced. "It was after the decision was made that I started seeing Katharina," he added. "This is something that Lisa was well aware of before it happened."</p><p>Lisa, on the other hand, disagrees. According to her friend who was quoted by <a href=# rel=nofollow>Page Six</a>, she wasn’t “aware” of any divorce. Lisa voiced her surprise at Lenny's change in behavior in her own statement. "With two young children involved, as a mom, I’m going to focus all of my energy and time on them," she explained. "I’m blindsided by his behavior and reckless handling of the situation."</p><p>Lisa was caught off guard by what had happened in the 'RHOM' Season 5 trailer, and she was skeptical that Lenny's new romance began immediately after the divorce process began. She tells Marysol Patton that she is "losing my husband, my best friend, to another woman" and claims that her personal trainer left her because Lenny hired him to train "the mistress." The trailer closes with Lisa on a furious phone call, presumably with Lenny, warning him that "there’s going to be a problem" if he lets "that girl" near their children.</p><p>Lisa and Lenny have already discussed their marital and reproductive issues in past seasons of 'RHOM.' When 'RHOM' returned for Season 4 after an eight-year sabbatical, Lisa confessed that Lenny had an "emotional affair" in the meantime, which caused them to split momentarily before reuniting and welcoming their two children. "Because we weren't succeeding at having a family, yeah, we almost got a divorce, and it was devastating," she explained. "But Lenny does not give up easily at all. So when he saw that I was serious, and I was done, he came groveling back... and it was the best decision of his life."</p><p>According to Lenny's counsel, the couple's prenup mandates Lisa to leave the family home within 30 days of either side filing for divorce or finalizing a divorce, whichever comes first. Lisa claims that several of her castmates who have gone through divorces, including her best friend Larsa Pippen, Alexia Nepola, and Marysol Patten, have sought assistance. Lenny has also moved on. He is presently dating Katharina Mazepa, a 27-year-old model.</p><p>Lisa recently <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">uploaded a video of herself</a> confronting her now ex-husband, Lenny Hochstein, and his girlfriend at a crowded Miami nightclub. The 'Real Housewives of Miami' actress is seen in the video, which was re-posted on her Instagram Story early December 30, flanking the plastic surgeon and Katharina Mazepa with her cellphone and its flashlight to capture them in flagrante delicto over Mother's Day weekend. What's most distressing is that, as Lisa approaches Lenny, Katharina looks right into the camera and licks her lips seductively.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpikum6%2F05qpZqSZqK5utM6cn6yslZ67br%2FHmpueq12dsrN5xLFkoqZdo7K4ediemKtloKTAtXnArGSsoJViwLWxz6xkqK2kYsSqwMdmqa6ln6eypXnBnpiuZZmjeq61wKag</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./weird-animals.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>11 Jaw-Droppingly Weird Animals That Are Too Alien To Be Earthly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./will-smith-the-rock-justin-timberlake-and-others-cheer-jamie-foxx-on-as-he-embarks-on-road-to-recovery.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Will Smith, The Rock, Justin Timberlake, and others cheer Jamie Foxx on as he embarks on road to rec</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
