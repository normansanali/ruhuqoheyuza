Initially working at a gas station, he later opened his own small barbershop in 1952. His barbershop, named “Johnny’s,” quickly became popular and a frequent place for many local politicians, businessmen, and celebrities.</p><p>In 1981, Murray married Betty Thompson, and they had two sons, Michael and Steven. Outside of work, Murray had a passion for golf and regularly participated in charity golf tournaments. He became a member of the Royal Canadian Golf Association in 1972.</p><p>Murray’s barbering career lasted until 2005 when he was 76 years old. Even after retiring, he often visited his old shop and socialized with customers. He passed away on November 29, 2023, at the age of 94. His funeral was solemnly held at St. Mary’s Church in Windsor in December 2023.</p><h3>A devoted husband and exemplary father</h3><p>In addition to his successful career, John Murray was known as a devoted husband and exemplary father.</p><p>He had a vibrant and happy married life, filled with care and mutual understanding. His wife once shared that John was an ideal husband, always attentive and understanding. Despite his busy schedule, he took the time every day to accompany her to work, cook, and take care of the household.</p><p>As a father, Murray showered his children with love and indulgence. Every weekend, he dedicated leisure time to fishing, playing golf, or watching football with his sons. According to his children, despite differing lifestyles, he always respected and supported their pursuits.</p><p>With his passing, the Murray family lost a strong pillar.

Many couldn’t hide their tears as they bid him farewell to his final resting place.
