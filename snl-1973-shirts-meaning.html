But what do the shirts mean?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What do the 1973 shirt from 'SNL' mean?</h2><p>The episode was hosted by Benedict Cumberbatch, and there were many hilarious sketches. Among the hilarity, there were also plenty of jabs against the U.S. Supreme Court, which is threatening to overturn the decades-old ruling of <a href=#>Roe v. Wade</a>. The 1973 shirts refer to the ongoing battle to defend abortion rights.</p><p>The landmark case of Roe v. Wade represented a turning point for reproductive rights in the United States. At the end of the trial, it was ruled that the U.S. Constitution protects a pregnant person's right to an abortion without excessive government interference. The decision was made in January 1973.</p><p>Since then, the topic of abortion has remained highly controversial in the United States, and the conflict reached a head in early May 2022.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>According to a leaked opinion obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico</a>, the Supreme Court is currently preparing to overturn Roe v. Wade. This would effectively outlaw access to safe abortions in many states. Protesters have since voiced their outrage against the Supreme Court, including the cast of Saturday Night Live.</p><p>Much of the cast, including Benedict himself, wore shirts that said "1973" on them. These shirts clearly laid out SNL's stance on Roe v. Wade as they stood to defend abortion rights.</p><p>Many sketches and jokes throughout the episode were also dedicated to the cast's political leanings. In a rare instance where the host is featured in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cold open</a>, Benedict is featured in a sketch criticizing the Supreme Court's views on abortion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLuteZBybmxlo522s8DSZqSemZ6eu6g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./apple-unveils-airpods-pro-a-new-design-with-active-noise-cancellation.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A New Design with Active Noise Cancellation</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cast-of-summer-house-friends-real-life.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Which Cast Members From 'Summer House' Are Friends In Real Life?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
