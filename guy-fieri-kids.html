The proud dad married his wife, Lori Fieri, in 1995, and the two have since welcomed two children together.</p><p>The boys are always featured on their famous father's Instagram account, so it's about time we learned all about them. Scroll down to meet Guy's kids!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hunter Fieri, 25</h2><p><a href=#>Hunter Fieri</a> was born on Aug. 7, 1996, which was the same year that Guy opened up his first restaurant, California Pasta Grill. Sweetly enough, it seems Hunter is following in his famous dad's footsteps by taking on a career in food.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like his father, Hunter attended the University of Las Vegas, Nevada, and graduated in 2019. However, he didn't just go there because his father did... he liked their program. "I chose to go to school at UNLV because it's one of the best places for hospitality. That’s why I wanted to go there," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Delish</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Guy Fieri and son Hunter</p></figure><p>Having had experience in his dad's restaurants, Hunter also elaborated on his future by sharing that he wants to follow the same culinary path that Guy has. &nbsp;</p><p>"I want to follow in the same path because I feel like I can kill it with that. I want it all. I want to open my own restaurants — to have things that I created and things my dad created and run this empire," he added. "I want the restaurants and the shows and the cookbooks — and more. I have to one-up dad, of course."</p><p>Hunter has also appeared as a guest on a plethora of his dad's shows, including Guy's Big Bite, Guy Fieri's Family Reunion, Guy's Family Cruise, Guy & Hunter's European Vacation, Guy's Family Road Trip, Guy's Grocery Games, Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, and Guy's All-American Road Trip, so he has a lot of experience on the small screen in case he starts his own show one day.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Guy Fieri (@guyfieri)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ryder Fieri, 16</h2><p>Ryder Fieri was born in 2005, nine years after his big brother, Hunter. At this time, it's unclear if the teenager wants to follow in his dad's footsteps considering he's only in high school, but we wouldn't be surprised if he ends up doing so since Hunter already has.</p><p>Similar to Hunter, Ryder has also appeared on many of his dad's Food Network shows, including Guy's Big Bite, Guy's Family Cruise, Guy & Hunter's European Vacation, Guy's Family Road Trip, Guy's Grocery Games, and Guy's All-American Road Trip.</p><p>The family of four lives in Santa Rosa, Calif., and it seems like their house is the perfect place for two active sons. “I built this house to be a place where the kids could hang out with their pals,” Guy gushed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Closer Weekly</a>. “We have a dirt-bike track, basketball hoops, a pool, pinball machines — you name it!” Guy sounds like he's an awesome dad if you ask us!</p><p>Guy’s All-American Road Trip premieres on June 3 at 9 p.m. EST on Food Network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnMK6ecWinKuhXaC2pb8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-crays-wife-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Robert Cray Dating Robert Cray's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-best-call-of-duty-warzone-20-weapons.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Warzone: best weapons for Season 4</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
