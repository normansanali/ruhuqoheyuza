During his career spanning more than three decades, he was a marquee weatherman for some of the major television networks in the United States. He spent most of his long career with the ABC Network on WABC-TV and also on&nbsp;<i>Good Morning America</i>.&nbsp;He also worked for The Weather Channel, where he was an editor and anchor on shows like&nbsp;<i>AMHQ: America’s Headquarters</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>23.5 Degrees with Sam Champion</i>.&nbsp;The multi-award-winning weather anchor also worked for NBC.</p><h2><strong><span>Biography of Sam Champion</span></strong></h2><p><span>He was born Samuel James Champion in 1961 on August 13.&nbsp;He was born in the town of Paducah in McCracken County, Kentucky.&nbsp;There is not much information about his mother Sylvia, however, his father, James H. Champion, is said to have been a US Marine who served in the Vietnam War.&nbsp;Sam grew up alongside a brother, a sister named Teresa.&nbsp;For his high school education, he attended Fairfax High School in Fairfax, Virginia, where he graduated in 1979.</span></p><p><span>Sam Champion was college educated at Eastern University of Kentucky where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Broadcast News.&nbsp;During his undergraduate studies, he had the opportunity to intern at a local television station, WKYT-TV, in Lexington, Kentucky.&nbsp;His first job after graduating was at WPSD-TV, located in his hometown of Paducah, Kentucky.&nbsp;His next job was with WJKS, based in Jacksonville, Florida.</span></p><p><span>In 1988, he was hired as a weatherman on WABC-TV, a flagship ABC station in New York.&nbsp;This marked the start of a very successful 18-year period in which he easily became the most watched meteorologist in the region.&nbsp;He joined ABC&nbsp;</span><i><span>Good Morning America</span></i><span>&nbsp;and ABC News in August 2006, which allowed him to extend his tenure with the network for another seven years.</span></p><p><span>During his time with the ABC network, Champion also appeared on other popular talk shows like&nbsp;</span><i><span>Live with Kelly and Ryan</span></i><span>&nbsp;on WABC-TV and&nbsp;</span><i><span>Larry King Live</span></i><span>&nbsp;on CNN.&nbsp;He was eventually replaced by Ginger Zee on&nbsp;</span><i><span>Good Morning America</span></i><span>&nbsp;when he left the network in December 2013.</span></p><p><span>Sam Champion joined The Weather Channel in January 2014. Apart from his role as the channel’s editor, he also co-anchored the morning show.&nbsp;</span><i><span>AMHQ: America’s Headquarters</span></i><span>&nbsp;alongside Mike Bettes and Maria LaRosa.&nbsp;His duties as co-host lasted&nbsp;</span><i></i><span>from March 2014 when the show debuted until September 2015. He began contributing to primetime programs on The Weather Channel after his release from&nbsp;</span><span>AMHQ</span></p><p><span>In March 2016, Champion was featured on his late night talk show titled&nbsp;</span><i><span>23.5 Degrees with Sam Champion</span></i><span>&nbsp;on the Weather Channel.&nbsp;He hosted several episodes of the series until December 2016, when his contract with the channel expired.&nbsp;He then left Weather Channel as his contract was not renewed.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Sam Champion gay, who is the husband?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sam Champion is an openly gay man and has been married for several years.&nbsp;He got married to Rubem Robierb on December 21, 2012, after several years together.&nbsp;Both are known to be very active LGBT activists.&nbsp;Robierb is a Brazilian visual artist.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sam Champion’s net worth stands at a whopping $10 million.&nbsp;Apparently, the veteran weather-years presenter has enjoyed sky-high paychecks during his long and distinguished career.&nbsp;He reportedly earned up to $1.5 million a year during his time at ABC.&nbsp;</span><i><span>Hello America</span></i></p><h2><strong><span>Where is he now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sam Champion was unable to grab a mainstream television hosting role soon after leaving The Weather Channel.&nbsp;This certainly contrasted with his previous experiences of changing jobs.&nbsp;However, he reported that the 2017 hurricane season for NBC News and MSNBC led to speculation that he might join NBC.&nbsp;In February 2018, he then returned to his former employer’s ABC network, where he served as a backup weather forecaster on&nbsp;</span><i><span>Good Morning America</span></i><span>.&nbsp;Given his level of expertise and immense professional experience, it’s only a matter of time before he returns to television.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGirkaJ6pLTApqeip55ir6q7jKecrWWZqHqpsYygmLJlp528tHnHrqqbmZ6Zeri0xKucZqGjYrWmec2ormg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teresa-rodr-guez.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teresa Rodrguez</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wwe-randy-orton-body-transformation-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Randy Orton's Body Transformation Shown In Photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
