Howard, born on the 5th of May, 1975, is a former American football player in the National Football League. He rose to fame during his tenure with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Denver Broncos.</p><p>So, what is Howard’s net worth? According to reliable sources, his net worth is estimated to be $6 million, as of early 2017, which he accumulated during his career as a professional football player.</p><h3>Chris Howard Net Worth $6 million</h3><p>Howard, hailing from Kenner, Louisiana, began playing football during high school. He was a prominent member of the Louisiana High School football team at John Curtis Christian High School. His exceptional skills led him to the University of Michigan.</p><p>During his time at Michigan, Howard played for the college’s football team, the Michigan Wolverines, as a running back. A defining moment in his college career was winning the 1997 National Championship and the 1997 NCAA Division I-A football in his final year.</p><p>In 1998, he was honored with the Hula Bowl MVP award. Upon his college graduation, he secured 1,876 yards rushing on 418 carries and 429 receiving yards on 60 receptions.</p><p>Following his impressive college performance, Howard swiftly entered the National Football League. In 1998, he was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the fifth round. His contract with the Broncos marked the beginning of his professional career and financial success.</p><p>Despite his consistent college performance, Howard faced challenges establishing himself in the professional league. He grappled with fumbling issues during pre-season practice with the Broncos, raising concerns among the team’s leadership. Consequently, the Broncos released him without him playing an official game.</p><p>Subsequently, Howard found a new opportunity with the Jacksonville Jaguars following his release from the Broncos. Although he encountered similar fumbling issues, the team persisted with him, nurturing his skills from the ground up. Through dedicated training, he showed improvement and eventually played for the team during the season.</p><p>Howard ultimately played with the Jaguars for three seasons before retiring from his professional football career in 2000. Despite his early retirement, his years in the NFL contributed significantly to his career and overall wealth.</p><p>In his personal life, Howard was married to actress Gabrielle Union. The two met at a party in 1999 and tied the knot in 2001, but sadly filed for divorce in 2006.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$6 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 5, 1975</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Kenner, Louisiana, UnitedWeight States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.78 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>101 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American football player</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Michigan, Louisiana High School football, John Curtis Christian High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Gabrielle Union (m. 2001–2006)</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2778987/</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiaoaqZqHqpu9aaqZ2rXZu8s8DUp5xo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./do-the-members-of-bts-have-pets-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Do the BTS Members Have Pets?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-winchesters-actor-drake-rodger-age.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;The Winchesters&amp;quot; Actor Drake Rodger Age, Height and Girlfriend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
