She is an actress, professional wrestler and model who came to real prominence in 2013 after she signed with WWE.</p><p>So how rich is Eva Marie? According to various sources, her net worth is estimated to be over $2.5 million as of early-2016, with her salary at $200,000. No doubt that her professional wrestling career has contributed the biggest part to Eva’s wealth.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=eva-marie-net-worth-25-million></span>Eva Marie Net Worth $2.5 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Eva Marie was raised in Concord, California, by her Italian father and Mexican mother, with three older brothers. Marie graduated from California State University, Fullerton with a Bachelors degree in&nbsp;business management and a minor in&nbsp;human resources. While studying there, Eva started working as a model and actress. Later, she gained a degree in art after graduating from Diablo Valley College.</p><p>Marie started her training in the WWE Performance Center&nbsp;in&nbsp;Orlando, Florida in 2013. After a few months, she was offered a part in WWE and&nbsp;E!’s&nbsp;reality show called “Total Divas”, which showed not only wrestling matches but also details of Divas’ personal life. Eva was on a break for a few months in 2014, but came back to defeatiAlicia Fox.</p><p>In 2015, Marie appeared in an episode of NXT, as she claimed that she wanted to compete in the NXT women’s division. However, the audience wasn’t very supportive and Eva was laboriously booed. Despite that, she has started contesting at NXT live events, and competed in the number one competition’s battle with Carmella, resulting in Carmella winning. However, Marie tried to exact revenge attacking her and Bayley, with Nia Jax, in the team match after more than ten episodes. Throughout her career spanning for only a few years, Marie was been trained at the WWE Performance Center, Natalya and Brian Kendrick. However, it is said by the critics that Eva Marie has much more success as an on-screen personality&nbsp;than a professional wrestler, since she’s never won any significant award. However, she has won the Powertech Model & Fitness Competition in 2012 and got a&nbsp;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&nbsp;award for Worst Worked Match of the Year in 2013.</p><p>As a model, Eva Marie has appeared on several magazine covers, such as Import Tuner Magazine, Glam Fit Magazine and others, and attended fashion competitions. Also, she has starred in various commercials for fitness campaigns, like Marino Fitness campaign and Sketcher advertisement. Eva Marie appeared on television as well, for example in the Spanish dating show&nbsp;called 12 Corazones. She was ranked as the number 83 in&nbsp;Maxim’s&nbsp;Hot 100 in 2014. Undoubtedly, work for advertising campaigns and modeling has helped to accumulate a part of Marie’s net worth.</p><p>In her personal life, she married Jonathan Coyle in 2014 and their wedding even appeared in an episode of Total Divas. Marie had a breast augmentation when she was 20 years old, however, after an injury during a fight, one implant was ruptured and silicone leaked into her blood stream. This situation required urgent surgery and new implant.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Eva Marie</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 19, 1984</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Walnut Creek, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.73&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>56.7&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Fitness model, actress, professional wrestler</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>California State University, Diablo Valley College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Jonathan Coyle (m. 2014)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Barry Nelson</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Nick Nelson, Neal Nelson, Nathan Nelson</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/EvaMarieWWEUniverse</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>https://twitter.com/natalieevamarie</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>http://www.instagram.com/natalieevamarie</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm4921550</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Wrestling Observer Newsletter award (2013)</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture – Drama, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or a Movie, National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress, BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles, Primetime Emmy Award …</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>North by Northwest, On the Waterfront, Winter’s Tale, Exodus, Superman Returns, Raintree County, A Hatful of Rain, All Fall Down, Nothing in Common, The Sandpiper, Because of Winn-Dixie, The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, The Stalking Moon, Grand Prix, 36 Hours, Don’t Come Knocking, I…</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Total Divas</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Bright red hair</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head><span class=ez-toc-section id=actress></span>Actress <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table class=actress><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>WWE NXT</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Eva Marie</td></tr><tr><td>NXT Takeover: Respect</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Eva Marie</td></tr><tr><td>WWF Raw</td><td>2013-2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Eva Marie</td></tr><tr><td>Swerved</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Eva Marie</td></tr><tr><td>NXT Takeover: Unstoppable</td><td>2015</td><td>Video</td><td>Eva Marie</td></tr><tr><td>WrestleMania XXX</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Eva Marie</td></tr><tr><td>Total Divas</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Eva Marie</td></tr><tr><td>Reality Bytes</td><td>2012</td><td>Short</td><td>Tina Tuna</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head><span class=ez-toc-section id=self></span>Self <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table class=self><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Dusty Rhodes: Celebrating the Dream</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Movie documentary</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>The Soup</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself – Guest</td></tr><tr><td>WWE Smackdown!</td><td>2013-2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Eva Marie</td></tr><tr><td>Total Divas</td><td>2013-2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself / Eva Marie</td></tr><tr><td>E!
