Beaton, starring Ashley Jensen as the titular character, a former PR executive who becomes an amateur sleuth in the Cotswolds. The series premiered on Sky One in 2014 with a pilot episode, followed by three more seasons commissioned by Acorn TV, a streaming service that specializes in British and international shows.</p><p>The fourth season aired in 2022, featuring four feature-length episodes adapted from the books Agatha Raisin and the Deadly Dance, Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell, Agatha Raisin and a Spoonful of Poison, and Agatha Raisin: There Goes the Bride. Here is everything we need to know about <a href=#>Agatha Raisin Season 5</a>:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Overview></span>Overview<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tr><th>Title</th><th>Agatha Raisin</th></tr><tbody readability=9.7771587743733><tr><td>Genre</td><td>Comedy-drama</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Creator</td><td>Barry Ryan and David Walton</td></tr><tr><td>Based on</td><td>The books by M.C.

However, there are some reasons to be optimistic that the show will come back for more episodes.</p><p>If we assume that the show has been renewed for a fifth season, the next question is when it will be released. The previous seasons of the show have had different production schedules and release dates, ranging from six months to two years between seasons. The fourth season started filming in March 2021 and finished in August 2021, and was released in December 2021 and February 2022.</p><p>Based on this, we can estimate that the fifth season, if greenlit, would start filming sometime in 2024 and be released later that year or in early 2025. Of course, this is just a speculation and may change depending on the availability of the cast and crew, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other factors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cast-of-Agatha-Raisin-Season-5.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cast></span>Cast <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The cast of Agatha Raisin Season 5 has not been officially announced yet, but we can expect most of the main and recurring actors to reprise their roles, unless their characters are killed off or written out of the story. The show’s lead star, Ashley Jensen, who plays Agatha Raisin, is likely to return, as she is the heart and soul of the series. Jensen is also busy with other projects, such as the Scottish crime drama Shetland, where she replaced Douglas Henshall as the main detective. However, this should not prevent her from continuing her role as Agatha, as British actors often juggle multiple shows at a time, given the shorter seasons and lower pay compared to American productions.</p><p><strong>Here is the table of the cast for Agatha Raisin Season 5:</strong></p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tr><th>Actor</th><th>Role</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Ashley Jensen</td><td>Agatha Raisin</td></tr><tr><td>Jamie Glover</td><td>James Lacey</td></tr><tr><td>Jason Merrells</td><td>Sir Charles Fraith</td></tr><tr><td>Mathew Horne</td><td>Roy Silver</td></tr><tr><td>Lucy Liemann</td><td>Sarah Bloxby</td></tr><tr><td>Jason Barnett</td><td>DCI Denzel Wilkes</td></tr><tr><td>Jodie Tyack</td><td>Toni Gilmour</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Some of the actors who appeared in guest or recurring roles in previous seasons may also return, depending on the storyline and their availability. These include:</p><ul><li>Taz Skylar as Harry Beam, Agatha’s former employee and love interest</li><li>Marcia Warren as Mrs. Boggle, Agatha’s eccentric landlady</li><li>Caroline Langrishe as Sheila Barr, Agatha’s rival and James’s ex-wife</li><li>Oliver Llewellyn-Jenkins as Rhys Davies, Eirwen’s brother and Agatha’s former fling</li><li>Ace Bhatti as Karim Khan, Agatha’s former client and friend</li><li>Rajat M Bose as Paul Abbasi, Agatha’s former client and friend</li><li>Dominic Rowan as Sylvan Dubois, Agatha’s former client and friend</li></ul><p>The fifth season may also introduce new characters from the books, such as George Selby, Agatha’s new love interest and a wealthy hotel owner; Toni’s boyfriend, Rob; and various suspects and victims of the crimes that Agatha investigates.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Power Book III Raising Kanan Season 4 Release Date</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Storyline-of-Agatha-Raisin-Season-5.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Plot_and_Storyline></span>Plot and Storyline <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The storyline of Agatha Raisin Season 5 has not been revealed yet, but we can make some predictions based on the books that the show’s producer hinted at adapting. The books are Hiss and Hers, The Busy Body, and Something Borrowed, Someone Dead, which are the 23rd, 21st, and 24th books in the series, respectively. The show does not follow the chronological order of the books, so it may change some details and events to fit the continuity of the series. Here is a brief summary of each book and how it may be adapted for the screen:</p><ul><li>Hiss and Hers: Agatha develops a crush on a handsome gardener named George Selby, who is hired by many women in the village. However, her hopes are dashed when George is bitten by a snake and dies. Agatha suspects foul play and decides to investigate, with the help of James and Charles. Along the way, she uncovers George’s dark secrets and faces a deadly enemy. This book may introduce George as Agatha’s new love interest, who may or may not survive the season. It may also feature some snake-related scenes and a confrontation with a killer.</li><li>The Busy Body: Agatha is hired by the Parish Council to organize a health fair in the village. However, things go wrong when the star attraction, a quack doctor named Dr. Toynbee, is found dead in his hotel room. Agatha teams up with Toni and Roy to find out who killed him and why. Meanwhile, Agatha has to deal with the arrival of Harry, who wants to rekindle their relationship, and the interference of Sheila, who tries to sabotage Agatha’s investigation. This book may bring back Harry and Sheila as Agatha’s romantic and professional rivals, respectively. It may also feature some scenes of Agatha and her friends trying out various health products and services, and a mystery involving a cult and a conspiracy.</li><li>Something Borrowed, Someone Dead: Agatha is hired by a woman named Gloria French, who wants to find out who is poisoning her jam. However, before Agatha can start her investigation, Gloria is found dead in her cottage, apparently strangled by a scarf. Agatha discovers that Gloria was not well-liked by the villagers, as she had a habit of borrowing things and not returning them.</li><li>Agatha has to find out who hated Gloria enough to kill her, and what secrets she was hiding. Meanwhile, Agatha has to deal with the jealousy of Toni, who feels threatened by Agatha’s relationship with George. This book may continue Agatha’s romance with George, and explore Toni’s character development. It may also feature some scenes of Agatha and her friends making and tasting jam, and a mystery involving a missing child and a hidden treasure.</li></ul><p><strong>READ ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Castaway Diva Episode 13 & 14 Spoiler</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Agatha_Raisin_Season_5_Spoiler></span>Agatha Raisin Season 5 Spoiler<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Agatha Raisin Season 5 will feature some major developments in Agatha’s personal and professional life, as well as some surprising twists and turns in the cases she tackles.
