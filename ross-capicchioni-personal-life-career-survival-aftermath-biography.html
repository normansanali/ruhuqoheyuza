scene and surviving 3 gunshots.&nbsp;The incident took place after Ross was taken to a dark neighborhood on Detroit’s infamous East Side.&nbsp;They took him there and he was shot by someone he once thought he was a friend.</span></p><p><span>His story of survival was extreme and showed the determination and will of the human mind to want to move on.&nbsp;It was a miracle that he managed to survive after being shot three times and the story went viral.&nbsp;It was also made into a two-minute documentary Aberrican Me: Ross Capicchioni, which was produced by Eric Koston and Steve Berra.&nbsp;Let us now learn more about the life of this gunshot survivor.</span></p><h2><span>Ross Capicchioni: early life, shooting incident</span></h2><p><span>Very little is known about Ross and his early years, but he was born on March 21, 1990. Capicchioni is from Macomb, Michigan, a suburb outside of Detroit.&nbsp;Growing up, he was just a normal kid and lived a simple lifestyle with his family and friends.</span></p><p><span>For education, Ross went to an average high school in Detroit and was a well-liked person among family, friends, and teachers.&nbsp;It was 2007 when Ross was home when a friend invited him for a ride to a cousin’s house on the east side of town.&nbsp;Ross tried to refuse, but after tireless pleading, he agreed to take his friend with him.</span></p><p><span>His friend was driving his along and Capicchioni was driving on Detroit’s east side.&nbsp;After approaching the destination, his friend asked him to stop the vehicle at the back of a house.&nbsp;Ross didn’t question and had no idea what was going to happen to him.&nbsp;They both got out of the car and, suddenly, a first shot landed on his left arm.</span></p><p><span>Capicchioni was shocked and looked at a friend who was a few meters from him, with a shotgun pointed at him.&nbsp;Ross was confused and bleeding profusely and asked his ‘friend of his’ if he had received the injection.&nbsp;Before he had a chance to finish his sentence, he was shot a second time;&nbsp;directly on his chest, creating a huge hole.&nbsp;Ross fell and heard a third shot hit him in the head.</span></p><h2><span>Ross Capicchioni: the story of survival</span></h2><p><span>After firing three shots, the would-be killer gave Ross a final blow to the face with the butt of the shotgun and took Ross’s car and drove away.&nbsp;Then the barely conscious body could see his supposed friend walk away leaving him to die.&nbsp;He was lying in the streets in the pool of blood that he has the will to live.&nbsp;Then Ross made up his mind and tried to get up.&nbsp;It was not easy for the boy to get up after being shot three times at close range.&nbsp;He was struggling but gave one last staggering attempt before falling back.&nbsp;However, this time, a probation officer saw Ross and immediately called for help.&nbsp;He stayed with Capicchioni and tried to encourage him to keep his eyes open.</span></p><p><span>Finally, ambulances arrived and took him to hospital, but the doctors suspected that it was probably too late.&nbsp;Ross was pronounced dead on his arrival at the hospital, but the doctors continued to do their best.&nbsp;He was taken to the emergency room for open heart surgery.&nbsp;After three days of tireless work, the hospital staff and doctors achieved the impossible.&nbsp;Ross regained consciousness and his breathing tube was removed.&nbsp;For three whole days, his family did not know his whereabouts even because of what he was going through.&nbsp;After some questioning, he contacted his family and they were finally able to see Ross.</span></p><h2><span>Ross Capicchioni: The Aftermath</span></h2><p><span>After only 5 days in the hospital, Ross was finally on his way home.&nbsp;The next day he was received by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).&nbsp;They showed up asking Ross to help them identify the possible killer with the shotgun.&nbsp;Ross was shown footage from which he was able to identify his attacker.&nbsp;Police arrested the boy and he was taken to court.&nbsp;Finally and rightly so he was sentenced to prison.</span></p><p><span>After years of the actual incident, the question remains: why Ross?&nbsp;Capicchioni says he was just being a helpful friend by taking him.&nbsp;However, he believes that his friend was trying to join a gang and to show that he was ready, he had to kill someone;&nbsp;unfortunately, he chose Ross.&nbsp;It’s all in the past now though, Ross is thankfully still alive after the assassination attempt failed.&nbsp;This also raises questions about gun laws in the United States of America.&nbsp;When is it okay to talk about these outbreaks of violence?</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3>Advertisement <a class=close-stky-ads onclick='if(!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers)return!1;document.getElementById("bl_banner").style.display="none"' data-cf-modified-28b060741220fe23ec0496f0- href=#></a><p>Copyright © 2024.
