The incident occurred outside of the grocery. Donnie Smith, who was 53 years old and the father of three children, passed away on Monday as a result of an assault that took place on December 6 in front of a Kroger Supermarket located at The Great Southern Shopping Center on South High Avenue.</p><p>When Nicole Evans was asked to describe her partner of twenty years and the father of her son, who was fifteen years old, and her daughter, who was six years ago, she answered, “Donnie was an amazing person.” “He was a great father, he loved his kids, they were his world.” The assault reportedly took place when Smith was out with friends doing grocery shopping, according to Evans. From a report that was received by WSYX from the Columbus Police Department: “An incident broke out between three males and customers who were present inside the establishment.</p><p>Due to this, the security personnel requested that the suspects leave the premises. As soon as they were outdoors, the victim was involved in a physical conflict with three fellow males.<br>Smith was ambushed by the group when he stepped out of the Kroger supermarket, according to a witness who spoke to WSYX. Smith was discovered by a store employee a short while later, having been savagely assaulted close to the drugstore drive-thru counter.</p><p>“These individuals immediately snatched him and then battered him to death,” according to Evans. “It was a random act of violence.” With significant brain damage, Smith was transported to a nearby hospital, where he is still in critical condition. “It sickening,” commented Evans, “I don’t know how anyone could do that to a human being.” According to Evans, Smith didn’t have any insurance and worked as a painter in the construction industry. In order to provide assistance to his young children at this difficult time, his family and friends have established a fundraising account on the internet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiao5x7prDUZ62nZ5Sku6%2B1xGaqpqGknXqwrsitrJqqqWKwsLjUppmuq12ktaq7jKaYp2WbnrmtscNmmJ%2Bslad6o77UrZilZZGpwaKvymamrqyjnrGmedKup56qnZa%2FrLHTZquhnV2svLO4w2amm6GkqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./monica-cline-md.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dr. Monica Cline, MD Ironton, OH</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dancing-with-the-stars-live-tonight-olivia-jade-bashed-for-downplaying-college-admissions-scandal-on-show-premiere.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dancing with the Stars LIVE tonight Olivia Jade bashed for downplaying college admissions</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
