No, not that show, the other one. ABC’s The Good Doctor, which stars Freddie Highmore as a surgeon with autism, premiered this fall with <a href=#>ratings that just kept rising</a>. Last night, Fox debuted The Resident, a decidedly much darker doctor show starring Matt Czuchry as the titular resident, a bad boy with as scraggly a beard as it’s possible to get from <a href=#>the guy who was the Yale love interest on Gilmore Girls</a>. You may love one of the new doctor shows and hate the other, you may like them both, or you may never watch either and only know of their existence from all of those billboards and commercials. The point is, we are now here to help you tell them apart.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjcqauiaw00153k5z66rbkksg@published>Who plays the doctor?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl2kjjo00233d610dg6tjdn@published data-word-count=33>The Good Doctor stars Freddie Highmore, a British actor who started off as a kid in movies like Finding Neverland and August Rush and more recently starred in <a href=#>Rihanna’s favorite show, Bates Motel</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjcl2mh8d00283d61izukqfn2@published data-word-count=36>The Resident stars Matt Czuchry, who was the douchey Yale boyfriend Logan on Gilmore Girls and lawyer Cary Agos on The Good Wife.
