Overall, the Canadian superstar is someone who has been relevant in culture for over a decade. In fact, he is creeping upon two decades in the game. Whether it be as an actor or as a musician, <a href=# rel>Drake has been able to establish himself as incredibly talented</a>. That said, it should come as no surprise that he continues to sell millions of albums. Additionally, he racks up billions of streams.</p><p>That said, <a href=# rel>the artist is also very active on social media</a>. Mostly, however, he likes to spend his time on Instagram. It is here where he likes to post memes as well as his various sports bets. Although, there are some instances where he likes to get a bit more provocative. Drake will find himself posting thirst traps because he knows it will cause some engagement. Furthermore, it could very well lead to a DM from a woman he may or may not have his eyes on.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drake-exudes-confidence>Drake Exudes Confidence</h2></span><p>Recently, that is exactly what Drake did as he took to his Instagram story with a photo of himself in nothing but a towel. Moreover, he gave the photo the caption, "5 min cold plunge for the soul." Immediately after posting the photo, it made its way over to Twitter. Although some people were thirsting over Aubrey, there were plenty of others who used this time to question the artist. For instance, some people asked who took the photo. Meanwhile, others implied that Drake has gotten some serious work done on his body, including liposuction.</p><p>In the tweets down below, you can get a general sense of what the reactions were to all of this. Overall, it remains to be seen whether or not Drake will ever be this vulnerable again. He can either let this reaction get to him, or he can keep it moving. We guess he will just keep it moving. Stay tuned to HNHH for the latest news and updates from around the music world.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-twitter-reacts>Twitter Reacts</h2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdma396gZRmm6uZm5p6s7XDopqupJViwam10ayrZqyilr0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emma-roberts-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emma Roberts Net Worth : Career &amp;amp; Books</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dani-morgan.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dani Morgan</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
