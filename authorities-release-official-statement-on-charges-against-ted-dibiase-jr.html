Now, he is facing some serious charges, and the authorities have dropped an official statement on the matter.</p><p>In case you didn’t know, the <a href=#>son of The Million Dollar Man pled guilty to</a> one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States. <a href=#>Brett DiBiase&nbsp;previously pled guilty&nbsp;</a>to two charges in Hinds County Circuit Court. He currently faces up to five years in federal prison and a fine of up to $250,000 in addition to his sentence in state court.</p><p>In the official press release by police, they detailed exactly what kind of situation was going on, and how programs like The Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families were defrauded.</p><p>The Department of Justice sent out the following press release:</p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>Thursday, April 20, 2023</p><p>Former Professional Wrestler Charged with Theft of Millions of Dollars in Federal Funds Intended for Needy Families</p><p>A federal indictment was unsealed today in Mississippi charging a former professional wrestler with misappropriating millions of dollars in federal safety-net funds intended for needy families and low-income individuals in Mississippi.</p><p>According to court documents, Theodore Marvin DiBiase Jr., 40, of Madison, along with co-conspirators John Davis, Christi Webb, Nancy New, and others, are alleged to have fraudulently obtained federal funds – including from The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program – that they misappropriated for their own personal use and benefit.</p><p>Davis was the executive director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services (MDHS). As part of the alleged scheme, after federal funds were issued to MDHS, Davis directed MDHS to subgrant the funds to two nonprofit organizations, Family Resource Center of North Mississippi Inc. (FRC) and Mississippi Community Education Center (MCEC), which were operated by Webb and New, respectively. Davis then allegedly directed Webb and New to award sham contracts to various individuals and entities purportedly for the delivery of social services, including at least five sham contracts that were awarded to DiBiase’s companies, Priceless Ventures LLC and Familiae Orientem LLC.</p><p>As further alleged in the indictment, under these sham contracts, FRC and MCEC provided millions of dollars in federal funds from MDHS to DiBiase and his companies for social services that DiBiase did not provide and did not intend to provide. DiBiase allegedly used these federal funds to buy a vehicle and a boat, and for the down payment on the purchase of a house, among other expenditures.</p><p>DiBiase is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to commit theft concerning programs receiving federal funds, six counts of wire fraud, two counts of theft concerning programs receiving federal funds, and four counts of money laundering. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for the conspiracy count, a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each wire fraud count, and a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison for each count of theft concerning programs receiving federal funds and for each count of money laundering.</p><p>Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Darren J. LaMarca for the Southern District of Mississippi, Special Agent in Charge Jermicha Fomby of the FBI Jackson Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Tamala Miles of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG), Special Agent in Charge Dax Roberson of the Department of Agriculture Office of Inspector General (USDA-OIG), and Special Agent in Charge James E. Dorsey of the IRS Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) Atlanta Field Office made the announcement.</p><p>The FBI, HHS-OIG, USDA-OIG, and IRS-CI are investigating the case.</p><p>Trial Attorney Adrienne E. Rosen of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, Trial Attorney Della Sentilles of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dave Fulcher and John Meynardie for the Southern District of Mississippi are prosecuting the case.</p><p>Police may make an example about this case. After all, they did title the release, “Former Professional Wrestler Charged with Theft of Millions of Dollars in Federal Funds Intended for Needy Families.” <a href=#>NFL legend Brett Favre </a>was even involved in that scandal.</p><p>We’ll have to see how things play out from this point on. There is a lot to unpack, but the legal system is certainly doing their jobs on this one.</p><p>What’s your take on this criminal case? Do you think they will throw the book at Ted DiBiase Jr?
