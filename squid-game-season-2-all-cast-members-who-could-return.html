One of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>’s most popular series will be returning for a second season. <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Squid Game</a></strong>, the South Korean series depicting a set of murder games where 456 people competed for the ultimate prize of 45.6 billion Won. The first season of the practically stole everyone’s attention when the show was released, so the second chapter is highly anticipated.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>The characters were taking part in life-and-death games with only one winner. Therefore the number of cast members who could possibly return for the second season of the series is limited, to say the least with most of our favorite characters dying in the first iteration. Let’s take a look at who might return for the second season of Squid Game.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-who-might-return-in-squid-game-season-2 data-injectable=false>Who might return in Squid Game season 2?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pS3v9LTUjT</a></p>— Squid Game (@squidgame) <a href=#>June 12, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>Lee Jung-jae will most likely be coming back to play Seong Gi-hun, and this has the highest probability of any of the characters in the series. After all, he won the competition and returned to the outside world, but he seemed adamant to find out who is still running the games and putting a stop to them. Indeed, he has been confirmed to return by the creator of the series, Hwang Dong-hyuk when he confirmed that there would be a season two.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=703 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>The only other confirmed character to be announced was The Front Man, played by Lee Byung-hun. He was the man who ran the Squid Game and was revealed to be Hwang In-ho, the brother of Hwang Jun-ho, the police officer we followed throughout the series as he attempted to rescue his brother, who it turns out did not need rescuing. Hwang Jun-ho was played by Wi Ha-joon, and he might return as well. While Hwang In-ho did shoot his brother toward the end of the series, he only shot him in the shoulder, and Hwang Jun-ho fell off a cliff. Not seeing the body is essentially a guarantee that he survived both his fall and the gunshot wound, so his return in the second season would not be too surprising.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>There is one other character that the letter written by Hwang Dong-hyuk states might return, and that is the man in the suit with the ddakji, who was played by Gong Yoo. He recruited Seong Gi-hun into the Squid Game. He was left alive by the season finale, so there are few reasons why he could not return. In fact, he will most likely be instrumental in Seong Gi-hun returning for the next Squid Game if that is what happens in the future.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hoyeon-jung-squid-game-2022-emmys-gallery-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hoyeon-jung-squid-game-2022-emmys-gallery-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hoyeon-jung-squid-game-2022-emmys-gallery-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hoyeon-jung-squid-game-2022-emmys-gallery-5.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hoyeon-jung-squid-game-2022-emmys-gallery-4.jpg><p data-characters=567 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=false>Even though these characters could return, do not rule out anyone else. We could always get a flashback to the last Squid Game or a surprise evil twin. It does seem like everyone would like HoYeon Jung to come back as Kang Sae-byeok. There’s also a pretty good chance that some of the VIPs return for the second season as well. Aside from that, it is doubtful that any of the main cast members from the first season would reprise their roles, but we’ll find out soon as the second season of Squid Game should be arriving on Netflix sometime between 2023 and 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0vdSim2afkaKybr%2FEmqqopl1neqK4y2aamqukYrqmucGeqaxlp528bq%2FOrqOdZaKawba%2BzWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./behind-the-scenes-iconic-films.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stunning Shots Of Your Favorite Iconic Films</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./return-of-wizards-of-waverly-place-and-anticipated-reboot-release-date.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Return of Wizards of Waverly Place and Anticipated Reboot Release Date</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
