And while not all of the show’s stars are wealthy, they do receive a certain amount of money from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bravo</a> for each episode or season they’ve appeared in.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ScreenRant</a>, Southern Charm‘s main cast members get paid $25,000 per episode, regardless of how many seasons they’ve appeared on. Each season has had anywhere from 10 episodes (season 1) to 17 episodes (season 8), which means that a main cast member could make up to $425,000 for one season. Back in 2019, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RadarOnline</a> reported that cast members received a bonus paycheck of $60,000 for the reunion taping.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>That number is in line with what the cast’s fellow Bravo stars across the country were reported to be raking in per episode. A feature from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> published in 2020 reported that the main cast of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanderpump Rules</a> made around $25,000 per episode after signing new contracts in 2017 and 2018.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>However, the cast members’ salaries for the show are but a drop in the bucket for many of the Southern Charm stars. Some of them, like Shep Rose, come from wealthy families, while others, such as Craig Conover, have leveraged their public personas into profitable relationships with other brands and ventures off the screen.</p><p data-characters=556 data-current-count=556 data-injectable=true>The cast member with the largest net worth is friend of the cast Patricia Altschul. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, she has a net worth of $100 million. Altschul’s late husband, Arthur Altschul, was a Goldman Sachs Group partner, and the two were well-known in New York City’s social circles. The so-called grand dame of Southern Charm has also launched a home decor line, and published a book called The Art of Southern Charm. The show has often showcased Altschul’s large and elegant home, where she is also known for having a butler.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>She’s Rose, an OG of Southern Charm, has sometimes spoken about his comfortable background on the show. Rose’s family is a wealthy one, and the reality star has shared that he doesn’t really need to hold a regular job. Outside of his work as a reality TV star, Rose has invested in some real estate and Charleston bars, and his net worth is reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a> to be $5 million.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>Leva Bonaparte, another regular cast member on Southern Charm, has a net worth estimated to be $3.6 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thrilling</a>. Bonaparte and her husband Lamar own and run several bars and other businesses in Charleston, including Bourbon N’ Bubbles and Republic, which was the site of the Southern Charm spinoff, Southern Hospitality.</p><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=850 data-injectable=true>As for Conover, the original Southern Charm star’s net worth is estimated to be $400,000. Conover has used his Bravo fame to launch a successful pillow company, Sewing Down South. He also launched a podcast, Pillows and Beer, with his co-star Austen Kroll. In addition to appearing on Southern Charm, Conover has also made several guest appearances on Bravo show Summer House, thanks to his relationship with that show’s star, Paige DeSorbo, and has also appeared on two seasons of Winter House.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>Speaking of Kroll, his net worth is reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Slice</a> to be $1 million. The longtime cast member comes from a well-off family, but has also appeared on other Bravo shows, launched his own craft beer company called Kings Calling Brewing Co., and has a podcast with Conover.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmpK6bmGKxsLHSZquhnV2YrrTAjKidZqufqsGpsdGnZJygkae6brnApJxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-lord-miles-missing-wikipedia-bio-and-domain-6.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Lord Miles Missing Or Is He Still In Afghanistan?
