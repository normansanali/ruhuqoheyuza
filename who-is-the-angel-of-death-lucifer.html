The character only appears in two episodes in the supernatural series, but she has an integral role.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p><strong>SPOILER Alert: This article contains spoilers for </strong><strong>Lucifer.</strong></p><p>Since it debuted in 2016, the dramedy <a href=#>Lucifer</a> has survived a Fox cancelation, and it's had several "final" seasons on Netflix. Fans haven't been able to get enough of the titular devil himself (played by Tom Ellis), his love interest, Detective Chloe Decker (Lauren German), or the other supernatural and human characters on the show.</p><p>The series officially concluded after <a href=#>six seasons</a> on Sept. 10, and viewers are learning how it all ends for Lucifer and for his loved ones. In the fifth episode, "The Murder of Lucifer Morningstar," <a href=#>Lucifer</a> learns that he abandoned his future daughter, Rory Morningstar (Brianna Hildebrand). He determines that the only way this could have happened is if someone killed him with the blade from the Angel of Death.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Though the Angel of Death, Azrael, isn't physically present in Season 6, her blade is a key component in the final set of episodes. Read on for the refresher on Lucifer's younger sister, and to find out more about the actor who plays the Angel of Death.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is the Angel of Death in 'Lucifer'?</h2><p>Azrael aka the Angel of Death is Lucifer's younger sister (played by Charlyne Yi), and she is in charge of bringing deceased humans to their eternal resting place — whether that's in Heaven, or in Hell.</p><p>She is the owner of the Blade of Death, which originated from the Flaming Sword. It has the power to completely eliminate the soul of any person who is killed with it (even Celestials).</p><p>Viewers are physically introduced to Azrael in the penultimate episode of Season 3, which is entitled "Boo Normal." Her second and final appearance in the show is in the Season 5 finale, "A Chance at a Happy Ending."</p><p>She's present during the final battle, and when Lucifer takes over from God (Dennis Haysbert) in Season 5.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>In Season 6, Lucifer is in possession of the blade, but it later goes missing. He ultimately finds out that Chloe took it, and he concludes that she could be the one who kills him. After a struggle, Chloe recognizes that she has been manipulated by the weapon. She knows she could never truly harm Lucifer, and she drops the blade. He returns Azrael's Blade to Heaven, which deactivates the power of Amenadiel's necklace.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What else has Charlyne Yi appeared in before?</h2><p>The 35-year-old actor (whose pronouns are they/them) rose to fame with a career in stand-up comedy before taking on the role of Lucifer's younger sibling.</p><p>Charlyne made their on-screen acting debut as Jodi in the 2007 comedy Knocked Up.
