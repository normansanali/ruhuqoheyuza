Their relationship has been extremely private compared to all of Taylor's previous ones. Recently, the two have been a little more open about their relationship and discussing each other during interviews.

Since they started dating the same year they've both done a great job keeping things out of the public eye regardless of how famous Swift is. They've certainly succeeded in making their relationship a topic of speculation for fans who want to know more.</p><p>After Swift's album Reputation, she released Lover, Folklore, and Evermore. These albums gave fans some insight into Swift and Alwyn's relationship. <a href=#>The albums were all packed with songs about falling in love</a>. This made it pretty clear to fans that their relationship was a strong one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Taylor Swift Has Done Since She Started Dating Joe Alwyn</a></span></p><p>After years of being together and being spotted only a couple of times in public together, fans really thought they were engaged, planning a secret wedding, or even already married. The rumors were even more fueled when it was <a href=#>rumored that there were plans for an upcoming private wedding ceremony in 2020.</a> It seems those rumors aren't really true but are not 100% confirmed to be false.</p><p>In an interview just last month, Alwyn commented on the engagement/marriage rumors. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“I mean, the truth is, if the answer was yes, I wouldn’t say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn’t say.”</a> Alwyn said in an interview.
