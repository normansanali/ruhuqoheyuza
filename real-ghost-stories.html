Carolyn and Roger Perron and their five daughters began to notice strange occurrences almost immediately.</p><p>Oddly enough, they continued to live there for nine years.</p><p>Andrea Perron was 12 years old at the time and claimed the film was “a beautiful tapestry” with “many elements of truth to it, and some moments of fiction.” Little did the Perron family know that the 200-acre home was said to have once been inhabited by a woman named Bathsheba Thayer and her four children, three of whom died young.</p><p>The town labeled Thayer a satanist who allegedly hanged herself from a tree in the backyard, and the Perrons were allegedly attacked by her spirit. Some of these incidents were harmless. Some claim she never lived there at all.</p><p>Other incidents on the property, however, were fairly violent.</p>The official trailer for The Conjuring, courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures.<p>The Perron children allegedly played and did chores with some of the spirits. Thayer’s ghost was not as friendly. She purportedly moved furniture to scare the new tenants, appeared fully at times, and as depicted in the film, haunted the family’s matriarch most of all. Carolyn Perron was allegedly pinched and forcefully slapped by Thayer’s ghost.</p><p>“Whoever the spirit was, she perceived herself to be mistress of the house and she resented the competition my mother posed for that position,” said Andrea Perron.</p><p>The Warrens were hired to help in 1974, but the Perrons eventually asked them to leave after Carolyn Perron became temporarily possessed. Her daughter allegedly witnessed this first-hand.</p><p>“I thought I was going to pass out,” she said. “My mother began to speak a language not of this world in a voice not her own. Her chair levitated and she was thrown across the room. Both my mother and I would just as soon swallow our tongue than tell a lie. People are free to believe whatever they want to believe. But I know what we experienced.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The so-called “Conjuring House”</a> where the Perron’s experienced the paranormal has recently been bought by two new owners. The fearless couple said they haven’t felt anything “evil” in the house, though it is certainly “busy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyzscClZKCgn6jBbr%2FTqKminaNkfw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./4-4-kg-to-lbs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>4.4 kg to lbs - 4.4 kilograms to pounds Conversion by NCESC</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./honey-i-shrunk-the-kids-reboot.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' Is Reportedly Getting a Reboot See the OG Cast Today!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
