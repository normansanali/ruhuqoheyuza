He started his music career in 2013, and a series of mixtapes helped him become well-known in the Southern music industry. With the release of his singles "Miss It" and "Ice on My Baby" from the mixtape Investments 4, which featured guest performances from YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Yung Bleu made a comeback in 2017. He later made remixes of "Miss It" and "Ice on My Baby" in 2018 with Kid Ink and Kevin Gates, respectively.<p>Yung Bleu's final recordings for Columbia Records and Bad Azz Music were the mixtape Inv 5 and the EP Bleu Vandross, both of which were released in 2020. The EP Love Scars: The 5 Stages of Emotions was released the same year after he obtained deals with Empire Distribution and Dream Chasers Records. The EP included Drake's remix of the Canadian rapper and singer's single "You're Mines Still," which peaked at number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100. Love Scars: The 5 Stages of Emotions by Yung Bleu was able to climb the Billboard 200 chart as a result.</p><p>The songs "Thieves in Atlanta" with Coi Leray, "Baddest" with Chris Brown and 2 Chainz, and "Way More Close (Stuck in a Box)" with Big Sean were all released by Yung Bleu in 2021. His debut album Moon Boy, which was published on July 23, 2021, contained all three of the tracks. Drake, Gunna, Kehlani, and more artists make cameos on the album as special guests.</p><p>The lead single from Yung Bleu's second studio album Tantra, which was released on November 11 of the same year, was "Love in the Way" with Nicki Minaj.

They perhaps may accept lower fees too. If you are seriously interested in booking Yung Bleu or other talent shown on our site, we will research their desire and the specific fee for your live-streaming event or project request.</p><p>Yung Bleu's current work schedule and location in relation to your event's type, date, budget, and locality will play a primary factor in the acceptance of booking Yung Bleu for your party.

"How much does it cost to book Yung Bleu for an event?" is a frequent question we get. The final Yung Bleu booking price is contingent on many variables and the booking fee we may show is based on a range derived from our past experience with what will Yung Bleu charge for an event. An example fee to book Yung Bleu is in the starting range of $25,000-$39,999. However, any recent popularity change would cause a price fluctuation well beyond this example. Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement.</p><p>There is low probability to book Yung Bleu for a party with anything substantially less than the published booking cost price range. We will negotiate with the Yung Bleu agent on your behalf if your funding is in place. By not having funding ready then it will more difficult to book Yung Bleu, because they get many offers to work events that are at or above asking price. It is also important to consider the travel costs when researching the Yung Bleu booking fee, as additional expenses like this, as well as an entourage of staff and equipment, are not necessarily built-in to the booking fee range shown. If your budget does not factor that in, then there is no benefit for them to want to be hired. We do not personally speak for Yung Bleu, but in our experience in booking talent for over 25 years, this is generally the outcome of inadequate funding.</p><p><b>Type</b><br>Performer</p><p><b>Style</b><br>Rap-Hip Hop</p><p><b>Range</b><br>R&B, Rap-Hip Hop, Male, Age Group-18-30's, African American, American</p><b>Bookmark and Share</b><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaK4xKerZ6aVqXy0rcypo56skaGyr8COa3BucGFkxra6xmaZpZ2lZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hong-kong-protest-porn-sites.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hong Kong Porn Sites Shut Down In Support Of Pro-Democracy Protestors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./french-stewart.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>French Stewart Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Career, Married, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
