Nicki Minaj’s ex), and a woman,<a href=#> Rosa Acosta</a>. While much of the conversation around this story line focused on whether Nikki was faking a lesbian relationship as a stunt for attention, it distracted from a more notable undercurrent on the show: This was just one of many instances of the <i>Love & Hip Hop</i> franchise exploring relationships that include LGBTQ people. For every supposedly fake bisexual woman, there are plenty of real members of the black LGBTQ community who have had their experiences chronicled on the <i>Love & Hip Hop</i> franchise.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-58bd554003674fab47d509b5ddfd126a-3-0-0@published data-word-count=245>While the docu-soap franchise — which<a href=#> follows</a> the lives of young hip-hop musicians in New York, Hollywood, and Atlanta — isn’t an after-school special by any stretch of the imagination, it stages real and substantive conversations around gender and sexuality in ways the rest of TV hasn’t yet, particularly when it comes to racial minorities. Recently, reality television has begun to pick up the slack with shows like <i>The Prancing Elites</i>, and the Oxygen series featuring trans models, <i>Strut</i>. The <i>Love & Hip Hop </i>franchise is perhaps the most outwardly tacky, as it falls into the brand of reality TV that thrives on conflict, often in its most vicious forms. Take the relationship between rapper Miles Brock and producer Milan Christopher on the last season of <i>Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood</i>, which focused on Miles’s reluctance to come out to his ex-girlfriend and family. While the story line brought up controversial tropes like the widely debunked<a href=#> “down low” phenomenon</a> — which posits that some black men who are trapped in the closet date both men and women, therefore spreading HIV/AIDS — it also left a lasting impression: There are still black men out there like Miles who struggle with their sexuality, particularly in hip-hop. The attention Miles and Milan’s relationship gained in the press eventually led to the VH1 special<a href=#> <i>Out in Hip Hop</i></a>, a forum in which cast members, religious leaders, artists, and journalists (including myself) had a dialogue about homophobia in the industry.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-58bd554003674fab47d509b5ddfd126a-4-0-0@published data-word-count=143>The most recent season of <i>Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta</i> explored gender identity in two narratives that were most fascinating because of how honestly they exposed prejudices. Mimi Faust<a href=#> introduces</a> her new beau Chris Gould to her best friend, Ariane Davis, who wrongly assumes that the new couple is in a lesbian relationship. Mimi explains that Chris is a transgender man: “I identify myself as a female. Chris identifies herself [sic] as male. So we are not in a lesbian relationship.” Ariane, who is a lesbian herself, doesn’t understand, and asks Chris, “So you have an identity crisis?” Chris<a href=#> goes on to explain</a> in the confessional, “Mentally and spiritually, I identify as male, just in a female vessel.” The conversation highlights the biases within the LGBTQ community itself, where being gay or lesbian doesn’t automatically mean you know everything about sex and gender.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-58bd554003674fab47d509b5ddfd126a-5-0-0@published data-word-count=192>Whereas Chris’s conversations about gender are largely cordial, D. Smith, a Grammy-award winning producer and trans woman, often found herself in contentious settings on <i>Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta</i> with co-stars Waka Flocka Flame and Scrappy. In an<a href=#> interview</a><span> </span>with Power 105.1’s The Breakfast Club, Waka declared Caitlyn Jenner was “rebuking God” by being trans and alleged that “the devil” was playing tricks on her mind. (Following intense backlash, Waka<a href=#> “clarified”</a> his comments on Twitter.) Scrappy, too, attacked trans women,<a href=#> writing</a><span> </span>on Instagram, “You a man with a penis with a wig on. I gotta check these motherf*****s’ baby pictures nowadays.” D. Smith confronted Scrappy, explaining that his social-media posts were transphobic; they ended their conversation in an uneasy detente. D. Smith has said that her participation on the show was an attempt to bring about awareness. “This is the demographic that people need to see the most,” she<a href=#> told</a> the New York <i>Post</i>. “Fifteen years from now, some trans girl is going to have it so much easier than I did because I helped out.” (Smith has since said that she “barely made it through” the season and she wouldn’t be&nbsp;<a href=#>returning</a>.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-58bd554003674fab47d509b5ddfd126a-6-0-0@published data-word-count=96>Things didn’t go D. Smith’s way, but even these confrontations — which are often contrived by producers to bring about the conflict necessary to keep the melodrama going and fans tuned in — feel purposeful, and don’t let ignorant comments stand alone. While D. Smith may not have fully enlightened Scrappy or Waka, she likely impacted at least some of the minds of those watching at home. And more than anything, they feel like candid dialogues. It’s a stark contrast to Jenner’s E! docuseries, <i>I Am Cait</i>, where the artifice of staged conversations is more apparent.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-58bd554003674fab47d509b5ddfd126a-7-0-0@published data-word-count=83>Over the years, much of the conversation surrounding <i>Love & Hip Hop</i> has been<a href=#> relegated</a> to whether or not the shows reinforce racial stereotypes. Mona Scott-Young, an executive producer of the franchise, defended the show from this line of criticism,<a href=#> noting</a>: “The show was not created to represent all African-Americans. I think it’s clear that it’s these women’s stories. It’s set in a specific world and I don’t think that there’s anybody who’s navigated that world who would deny that these things happen.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-58bd554003674fab47d509b5ddfd126a-8-0-0@published data-word-count=168>The same can be said of the LGBTQ people featured. Some narratives might feel uninspired — the questioning of Nikki’s bisexuality, the secrecy around Miles’s sexuality — but to Scott-Young’s point, these things do still happen. And what makes <i>Love & Hip Hop</i>’s dialogues<i> </i>so effective are that they work within the framework that made the franchise so popular to begin with: chaos. LGBTQ people of color are depicted as messy and complicated, progressive and ignorant — just like straight people. And in some ways, the faces of <i>Love & Hip Hop</i> are more representative of the LGBTQ community at large than what we typically see. A<a href=#> 2012 Gallup poll</a> found that people of color self-identify as LGBTQ at a higher rate than white people, with black people self-identifying as LGBTQ more than anyone else. For all of the white faces typically associated with the LGBTQ community, D. Smith, Mimi Faust, Chris Gould, and yes, Nikki Mudarris, are more common than the media makes them out to be.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>How <i>Love & Hip Hop</i> Takes on Queer Sexuality</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlob2dhZXytu9WeZKGhoGK1sLyMmqWdZaGqsqa%2BjKycsa2Roba1xY2hq6ak</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./badou-jack-parents-meet-eva-nyberg-and-mr-jack.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Eva Nyberg and Mr. Jack</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./look-of-the-day.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Middleton Wore a Purple Suit With a Black Turtleneck</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
