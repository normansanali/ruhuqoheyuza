The facility was built on a hill due to the erroneous belief at the time that high altitude could cleanse patients of their mental illnesses.</p><p>As was typical of early institutions, the abandoned asylum took in a massive number of patients. At its peak, it housed about 1,200 patients and employed 700 staff members.</p><p>Also like most facilities of the 19th century, the "treatments" at Beechworth were notoriously violent. Doctors subjected patients to straitjackets and shackles. Electroshock treatments were common practice there, so much so that there were reportedly mass "shock sessions" where nearly the entire patient population was shocked simultaneously.</p><p>Given the extent of the mistreatment that took place at the asylum, it may not come as a surprise that the facility, which was finally closed in 1995, is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> to be extremely haunted. Those who worked at the hospital during its last years alleged that the hauntings began long before the hospital was shuttered.</p><p>One common spooky sighting is the ghost Matron Sharpe, who once worked at the asylum. She is said to have shown kindness to the patients and tried to improve their conditions. Later nurses alleged that she returned as a spirit whose presence was marked by a sudden chill in the room. She would reportedly stand watch over patients as nurses shocked them.</p><p>Other ghosts have allegedly been spotted by visitors during haunted tours around the abandoned asylum, which now sits empty and untouched in the same spot it was built over 150 years ago.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyirsCnm6imlZl6or%2FYpaymq19n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./breckin-meyer-always-thinks-about-brittany-murphy-reflects-on-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Breckin Meyer 'Always Thinks' About Brittany Murphy, Reflects on Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-wheel-of-time-cast-ranked-by-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Wheel of Time cast, ranked by net worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
