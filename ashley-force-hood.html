She made her first final round appearance of the year on March 30 at Houston, but lost to <a href=#>Del Worsham</a>. At Las Vegas, she was defeated in the final by <a href=#>Tim Wilkerson</a>, yet became the first female racer ever to lead the NHRA Funny Car point standings. On April 27, 2008, at Atlanta, Force's opponent in the final was her father, John, who was seeking to score the 1000th round win of his career. The younger Force claimed her first-ever NHRA Funny Car win that day, the first ever for a woman, with a 4.837-second elapsed time, the second quickest of the weekend in the Funny Car class.</p><p>She has two sisters, Courtney and Brittany, and an older half-sister, Adria.

She finished the year fourth in national driver points.</p><p>Force attended Esperanza High School in Anaheim, CA, where she was a cheerleader.
