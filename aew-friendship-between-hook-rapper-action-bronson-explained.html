In <strong><a href=#>AEW</a></strong> specifically, there have been numerous artists from the genre who have made their presence felt there. At AEW Rampage Grand Slam 2022, Action Bronson made his in-ring debut teaming with Hook. The friendship between Hook and Bronson goes beyond simply wrestling one match. Bronson and Hook are both mutual fans of one another in their respective fields. Since Hook’s debut, their friendship has further evolved. This all culminated in the two being tag team partners for a match against the Jericho Appreciation Society’s Matt Menard and Angelo Parker in New York.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hook-action-bronson-celebrate.jpeg><h2 id=hook-makes-his-aew-debut-to-one-of-action-bronson-39-s-songs>Hook Makes His AEW Debut To One Of Action Bronson's Songs</h2><p><a href=#>Hook’s first time stepping into the ring in AEW saw one of the greatest and most dominant debuts in company history.</a> For his entrance theme, Hook chose to use the track “The Chairman’s Intent.” The song came off of Bronson’s 2017 album, Blue Chips 7000. Hook has been a fan of Bronson since he was younger. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Pitchfork</a>, Hook said, ““I’ve been an Action Bronson fan since I was in sixth grade…I would hear him shout out all these old school wrestlers…”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How ECW Got Away With Using Real Licensed Music For Their Wrestlers</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bronson and<a href=#> Taz, Hook’s father and the ECW legend</a>, became friends because of this connection. Bronson was a big fan of ECW, noting that he had seen wrestlers such as Taz, The Dudley Boyz, and Sabu compete when ECW was still an active wrestling promotion. When asked about Hook wanting to use that song for his entrance, Bronson said on<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Ariel Helwani Show</a>, “Be my guest, please.” Bronson also did not care about making money from AEW for using it either. It was all out of pure and genuine respect. In addition, Tony Khan was also supportive of the decision to use the track as he believed it fit Hook’s character, with him saying, ““I liked it; I liked the idea, and I wanted to support them.”</p><h2 id=hook-and-action-bronson-take-on-the-jericho-appreciation-society>Hook And Action Bronson Take On The Jericho Appreciation Society</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/aew-grand-slam-poster.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At AEW All Out, Hook defeated Parker to retain <a href=#>the FTW Championship, a title which his father had created while in ECW</a>. It was revived in AEW as an unofficial title in the promotion. The two members of the JAS had been feuding with Hook, which is how the match came about. After the match, Hook was attacked by Parker and Menard. This led to Bronson coming out from the crowd to attack the two and defend Hook. Bronson challenged the two to come into the ring for a fight, but it did happen on this night. However, in due time they get their hands on the JAS.</p><p>At<a href=#> AEW Rampage Grand Slam 2</a>, Bronson and Hook got their fight against the JAS. Bronson and Hook made their way to the ring, with Bronson rapping the lyrics to Hook’s theme. It was Bronson’s first time as an in-ring competitor. He also had trained with Taz and Hook in the past. The two displayed great ability with each other, tagging in and out and delivering damage to the JAS members. To win the match, Hook and Bronson both locked in the redrum hold on both Menard and Parker to win the match by submission. It was a tremendous moment as Hook and Bronson are both from New York and picked up the win there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Has Happened To Hook In AEW?</a></span></p><h2 id=many-hip-hop-artists-have-been-seen-in-aew>Many Hip-Hop Artists Have Been Seen In AEW</h2><p>Hip-hop and professional wrestling have always had a link to each other, with Bronson’s appearance in AEW was not the first time that hip-hop has made its presence felt in AEW. JPEGMAFIA has made appearances in segments with Darby Allin. Westside Gunn performed his verse from the track “DR. BIRDS” for Daniel Garcia during his entrance on Dynamite for his ROH Pure Championship match with Wheeler Yuta. Rick Ross has also been an on-screen supporter of Swerve Strickland. It is safe to say that there will be much crossover between hip-hop and professional wrestling in AEW and other promotions as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 References To Pro Wrestling In Hip-Hop Fans Should Know About</a></span></p><h2></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/action-bronson-hook-win-jpeg.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The friendship between Hook and Bronson shows how intertwined all various different forms of entertainment are.
