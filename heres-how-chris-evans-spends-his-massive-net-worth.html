Let’s take a look at someone who knows how to have some fun with their cash!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chris Evans Almost Destroyed His Relationship With Brother Scott After Publicly Outed Him During An Interview</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated September 2023:</strong> Since his last appearance as Captain America in 'Avengers: Endgame', Chris Evans has been incredibly busy. From working on projects on both the big and small screen and even lending his voice to be Buzz Lightyear in 'Lightyear', Evans is working on increasing his <a href=#>net worth of $110 million</a>.</p><p>Evans' net worth may continue to rise further as a result of combining his fortune with his new wife's, Alba Baptista. Given that Baptista's acting career is taking off, she may be increasing her net worth in the future by leaps and bounds as well. As such, the two will be able to spend money as they please, given that by working hard they get paid the big bucks. And it is no fun to work hard without being able to play hard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Evans currently lives in a nearly 5,000-square-foot home, he may be upgrading that sooner rather than later given that the home only has three bedrooms. As such, if he and Baptista have plans to start a family, they may need a bit more room. If this is the case, that may just be where some of Evans' fortune goes in the future.</p><h2 id=chris-evans-has-cars-cars-cars>Chris Evans Has Cars, Cars, Cars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar49957537-1.jpg><p>Captain America knows a thing or two about cranking up the action in his movies, and in real life. This is something Evans has in common with the character. Not unlike other action stars in the business, Evans has put together an incredible <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">car collection</a> over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the most part, Evans is modest in this area, but this does not mean that he doesn’t know what he’s getting his hands on. When it comes to a daily driver, Evans has been spotted in the past with a Lexus ES350, and he has also been seen with a Jeep. This is a beautiful car that has a lot to love about it. While Evans could afford splashier and more expensive cars, he knows what he likes and it appears simpler cars are it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ana De Armas And Chris Evans Made A Bold Prediction For The Next Actor To Play James Bond</a></span></p><p>Now, while these two cars are all fine and dandy, there is a massive beast lurking in his collection that has been turning heads for some time. In 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Downey Jr. gifted Evans a $275,000 1967 Chevy Camaro</a>. Not only is a '67 Camaro a work of art already, but Downey made sure to have this car tricked out to be Avengers-themed.</p><p>This little car collection for Evans is quite impressive, and while not as extensive as other celebrities, is worth a pretty penny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-evans-likes-to-purchase-expensive-real-estate>Chris Evans Likes To Purchase Expensive Real Estate</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar50242124-1.jpg><p>Spending money on nice cars is one thing, but spending millions on impressive real estate is an entirely different ball game. Thanks to his riches from playing Captain America, Evans has been able to land himself some beautiful places to live over the years.</p><p>A few years before becoming Captain America, Evans, who was already doing well for himself in the industry, snatched up a $1.26 million Hollywood Hills home, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Eventually, he would put that property back on the market, and he would set his sights on something a bit pricier. Of course, a $1.26 million home has a lot to like about it, but clearly, he was ready to upgrade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, Evans was ready to make a move on some real estate. By that point, the MCU was in full swing and he was making some serious money.</p><p>Eventually, Evans would land himself a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.25 million pad in Los Angeles</a>. This place cost significantly more than his previous spot in the Hollywood Hills, but with that sweet MCU pay coming through, he probably didn’t think twice about purchasing the home.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Does Chris Evans Feel About Anthony Mackie As Captain America?</a></span></p><p>While Evans is not one for flipping properties like other celebrities are, it is clear that he is not afraid to spend a sizable amount of money on what he actually wants.</p><p>The cars and the houses are all great ways to spend money, but sometimes, a man needs to invest in himself, as well.</p><h2 id=chris-evans-spend-money-on-personal-style-and-fitness>Chris Evans Spend Money On Personal Style And Fitness</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar51797477-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite spending quite a bit of money on cars and houses, Evans was still willing to shell out more cash to take care of himself. As nice as it is to have luxurious things, taking care of yourself is always the most important thing.</p><p>One of the ways that Evans has invested in himself is by hiring a personal stylist. This is because, in Hollywood, it is important to look sharp at the year’s biggest events. Evans made the right choice by hiring someone who could give him some legitimate advice.</p><p>In addition to taking care of his personal style, Evans takes care of his personal health as well. This is precisely why Evans has worked with personal trainers. More specifically, Evans worked with former Royal Marine, Simon Waterson, who had also helped Daniel Craig transform into James Bond.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evans makes a lot of money, and he knows how to spend it better than most. Despite having the means to make ludicrous purchases, he chooses to keep things practical, which is why his net worth has grown to the fortune it has today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9ZmmqGqmah6psLAp6pmq6Cau6W%2FjKGgrGWdlsC0tdWeZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./poor-ina-garten-forced-to-hang-1-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ina Garten Agrees to Hang With Cancer Patient</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./glenda-jackson-films.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Glenda Jackson Films</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
