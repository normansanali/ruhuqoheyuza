The ceremony was well attended and included several familiar Hollywood faces including Tina Fey, Naomi Watts, Paul Rudd and of course Hamm’s friend and Mad Men costar John Slattery. However, one face that fans may not be as familiar with, is the bride herself. <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anna Osceola,</a></strong> aside from obviously being Jon Hamm’s new wife, may seem vaguely familiar to Mad Men fans as she made a cameo in season 7. Yet aside from those claims to fame, who is Anna Osceola?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=674 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>Hamm and Osceola met on the set of Mad Men, in the 2015 final episode of the series. Jon Hamm, naturally, plays Don Draper, the Manhattan marketing playboy. Yet as fans well know, by the end of the series his partying ways were no longer quite as endearing and the series ended with Draper’s attempt to find himself at a serene yoga and meditation retreat. The receptionist at the retreat, Clementine, was played by none other than Anna Osceola. The two met in 2015 but did not begin dating until 2020. After dating for two years the couple decided to tie the knot, in the very place that they met, the location in Big Sur, California, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">site of Don Drapers retreat.</a></p><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=89 data-injectable=false>So aside from her appearance in Mad Men, what else is Anna Osceola’s claim to fame?</p><h2 id=h-anna-osceola-and-jon-hamm-in-confess-fletch data-injectable=false>Anna Osceola and Jon Hamm in Confess, Fletch</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=750 data-injectable=true>Anna Osceola is a 35 year old actress who hails from Cambridge, Massachusetts but currently lives in California. Her acting career began in 2007 when she scored the role of Charlie in the made for TV movie Not Another High School Show. She has made appearances in several hit shows including Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, NCIS, Saving Grace and Greek.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>In 2022 she starred across from her new hubby <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in the movie Confess, Fletch</a>. Aside from that Anna is remarkably low key, especially for Hollywood. She likes to keep her private life, well, private, and doesn’t have a social media presence. Despite making several glamorous red carpet appearances with Jon, she seems to leave the photos to the paparazzi.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>Hamm too likes to keep his private life fairly off the grid and quiet. Prior to Anna, Jon was in a long term, 18 year relationship with girlfriend Jennifer Westfield, yet he avoided getting married, claiming he viewed it as a marker that someone was ready for kids. So now that he’s married, does that mean he’s ready for kids? Will we be seeing little Mad Men or women running around sometime soon? We can only hope.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jon-hamm-anna-osceola-1.png><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=758 data-injectable=true>If you were hoping for celebrity scandal, past career blunders or even juicy ex stories you are barking up the wrong tree, Anna’s past is remarkably drama free, as far as we can tell. The actress was born on April 8th, 1988 making her an Aries fire baby, and she is often spotted out and about walking her dog, and hitting the beaches. She is also 5’11 making her quite a bit taller than Hamm’s last lady love who stood at only 5’7.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>We know this info may not be exactly riveting but hey; what can we say, Anna Osceola is as down to earth as the hippy Clementine <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">character she played on Mad Men</a>. She seems a perfect choice for Hamm who had struggles in his past with alcohol addiction and mental health, even spending some time in a rehab facility. So a calm, stable, drama free partner might be just the ticket for this former Mad Men star.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>Anna Osceola may be relatively unknown prior to her big Hamm pair up but we are willing to bet we are about to see a lot more headlines with her name in them. Who knows, perhaps the next big announcement from the couple will be another addition to their new family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmmZ6jrm670pycqKSRYrqmsdNmoaimXZ2urrnSZqWer12Xv6qwxGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-tate-collins-linda-collins-smith-daughter-gives-an-account-of-grieving-her-mother.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Tate Collins?
