But after he lost to Brock Lesnar at WWE Crown Jewel, the former world champion laid out “The Beast Incarnate”, clearly frustrated with the outcome. The next night on RAW, Lashley attacked Mustafa Ali when the latter tried to accept United States Champion Seth Rollins’ open challenge. He then brutalized Rollins and Theory when Mr. Money in the Bank tried to cash in his contract on the champion.</p><p>Speaking on the November 9 episode of <a href=# rel=noopener>WWE’s The Bump</a>, Lashley discussed his actions and brought up the perceived heel turn. He stated that he’s just taking action now in order to get what he wants. He noted that his previously approach wasn’t getting him where he wanted to go, so he’s operating with a new perspective now.</p><p>“Well first of all, a lot of people kind of came to me, and they said, ‘Oh is Bobby turning heel?’ There’s no heel or babyface. There’s just actions,” Lashley said. “I’m still a nice guy, got a good smile, and I’m always gonna be the same person. It’s just that it comes in time in this business that you just have to start taking what you want. It seems like the people that are on top have just been taking what they want. I’ve always been the guy that kind of sat back in the back and said, ‘Well, what do you need?’</p><p>“I’m always that helpful person, and I’m always like, oh I’ll do it. It start gets getting to the point where that doesn’t really get what you want out of this business. So I’m trying to take things in my own hands. Right now, how I looked at it and a little birdie came into my ear and said, you know what, if you just start taking things and beating people up, who’s really gonna stop you? Seth has the title right now, but if I came to Monday and I just walked up to Seth and took that belt from around his waist, is there really anything that he could do about it?”</p><p>When asked whether his actions on RAW were motivated by the United States Championship, Lashley stated that respect is his main goal.</p><p>“It was about taking what I want and getting respect,” Lashley said. “In this business, it’s really hard to get respect because everybody thinks they should be the number one person.”</p><p>The former WWE Champion went to to explain that he knows he doesn’t have many years left as an active performer, and with that in mind, he’s taking what he wants.</p><p>“I don’t have very many years left in this busines,” Lashley said. “From now until I retire, I’m just gonna start taking what I want, and I don’t think anybody can stop me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJrb3BqZmKvsK7BsmSlmaOduabFjK2fnqqVqHqvu4yhnJ6kXaS%2Fbq7Am7CfmZOaeqq5jKOsrKxdqa6stc2gZLCgkal6qnnWmqWt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-you-smell-weed-through-vacuum-sealed-bags.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Can you smell weed through vacuum sealed bags?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./angelina-jolie-i-love-speaking-russian-2010127.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Angelina Jolie: &amp;quot;I Love Speaking Russian&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
