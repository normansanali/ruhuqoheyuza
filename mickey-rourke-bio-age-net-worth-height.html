London’s leg was in an air cast. He likely signaled goodbye to USC fans for the final time in a Trojan uniform when he was carted off.</p><p>While USC has yet to provide a much more precise update on the exact injury for London, an NFL draft analyst has a report that the receiver’s injury may not be as bad as originally feared. Here is what Matt Miller had to say about London’s injury on Sunday morning:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Per a source, USC wide receiver Drake London suffered a fractured ankle. He’s out indefinitely but the injury isn’t as bad as originally feared.</p><p>— Matt Miller (@nfldraftscout)&nbsp;<a href=#>October 31, 2021</a></p><p>London won’t be returning to the field this season, but this news is good in terms of his&nbsp;<a href=#>NFL draft stock moving forward.</a>&nbsp;The receiver has been quickly climbing draft rankings and is in the conversation to be a first-round pick.</p><p>Depending on the severity of this injury, he also has the chance to up the stock with workouts and the NFL scouting combine if healed in time. That would be best-case scenario at this point.</p><p>Keep in mind that medical evaluators and athletes who understand the rigors of competition generally regard a fractured ankle as less worrisome for an NFL career than a high ankle sprain. A fractured ankle (not yet the official diagnosis, keep in mind) sounds really bad, but it is not the worst possible diagnosis.</p><p>We’ll wait to see if this piece of speculation is in fact nailed down.</p><h2 id=drake-london-is-officially-out-for-the-season-with-a-fractured-ankle class=entry__title><strong>Drake London is officially out for the season with a fractured ankle</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/247newsaroundtheworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1235652711.jpg><p>The USC Trojans left their homecoming game with a bittersweet feeling. On one hand, they got the victory against a winless Arizona team. Yet, none of that mattered. Star wide receiver&nbsp;<a href=#>Drake London left the game</a>&nbsp;after scoring his second touchdown and had to have an air cast applied to his leg.</p><p>The Trojans and their fans held out hope for London to return this year. After all, he has been the only bright spot in what has been an extremely disappointing season in Southern California.</p><p>However, those hopes can be put to bed. London was announced out for the year by head coach Donte Williams on Sunday evening (h/t&nbsp;<a href=#>Ryan Abraham of USCfootball.com).</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Donte Williams said Drake London is out for the season with an ankle fracture.&nbsp;<a href=#>#USC</a></p><p>— Ryan Abraham (@insidetroy)&nbsp;<a href=#>November 1, 2021</a></p><p>This was the initial fear, and Williams just confirmed what everybody was hoping to avoid. Still, this is devastating news for everybody.</p><p>London was tearing defenses apart left and right and was set to shatter records and walk away as the nation’s top receiver. Furthermore, his draft stock had done nothing but rise, with some mock drafts even having him as a top-10 draft pick in the 2022 NFL draft.</p><p>Now, London will get drafted and SHOULD be a&nbsp;<a href=#>first-round choice</a>, but the injury could create some complications with teams eyeballing the star wideout.</p><p>Nonetheless, Drake London’s time with USC has officially come to an end. His final catch will be a touchdown grab, and he finished the year with 88 catches for 1,084 yards and seven trips to the end zone.</p><p>This is just devastating news for the Trojans, and now they go back to the drawing board to find a way to overcome this massive loss.</p><p>One small positive: This is a fractured ankle and not a high ankle sprain. This was not the worst possible injury diagnosis for London.</p><p>Much more on this story Monday and during the week at Trojans Wire.</p><h3 id=recommended-articles class=jp-relatedposts-headline>RECOMMENDED ARTICLES</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8CfqaKbkWS6qq%2FKnrBmqp%2Bqv6yxjJugqGWRnLJuusStZLCnoqm1brTEop6hrF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./in-season.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>28 Seasonal Favorites + Carrot Top Pesto</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-many-duggars-are-married-2022-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Which Duggars Still Live At Home (Unmarried) In 2023?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
