He also voiced B.P. Richfield in Dinosaurs and appeared in many other shows and movies. He was known for his comedic talent, his distinctive voice, and his memorable catchphrases. But how did he die and what was his cause of death?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Early Life and Career</strong></h3><p>Sherman Alexander Hemsley was born on February 1, 1938, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was raised by his mother, who worked in a lamp factory, and did not meet his father until he was 14. He dropped out of school after the tenth grade and joined the United States Air Force, where he served for four years. After leaving the Air Force, he returned to Philadelphia and worked as a postal clerk while attending the Academy of Dramatic Arts at night. He then moved to New York City, where he continued to work for the post office while pursuing an acting career.</p><p>Hemsley made his Broadway debut in 1970 in the musical Purlie, where he played Gitlow. He toured with the show for a year and received positive reviews for his performance. In 1971, he was contacted by Norman Lear, the producer of the sitcom All in the Family, who wanted him to play George Jefferson, a recurring character who was the neighbor and rival of Archie Bunker, the main protagonist. Hemsley was reluctant to leave his theater role, but Lear assured him that he would hold the role open for him. Hemsley joined the cast of All in the Family in 1973 and quickly became a fan favorite.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Jeffersons and Beyond</strong></h3><p>In 1975, Hemsley and his co-star Isabel Sanford, who played his wife Louise Jefferson, were given their own spin-off show called The Jeffersons. The show followed the lives of George and Louise Jefferson, a successful African-American couple who moved from a working-class neighborhood in Queens to a luxury apartment in Manhattan. The show was a huge hit and ran for 11 seasons until 1985. It was one of the longest-running sitcoms in American television history and one of the first to feature a predominantly black cast. Hemsley received an Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe nomination for his role as George Jefferson, as well as an NAACP Image Award.</p><p>After The Jeffersons ended, Hemsley continued to work steadily in television and film. He starred in another sitcom called Amen from 1986 to 1991, where he played Deacon Ernest Frye, a lawyer and church leader. He also lent his voice to several animated shows, such as Dinosaurs, where he played B.P. Richfield, a tyrannical boss of a dinosaur company; Captain Planet and the Planeteers, where he played Dr. Blight’s henchman MAL; and Family Guy, where he reprised his role as George Jefferson in a parody episode. He also appeared in movies such as Ghost Fever, Love at First Bite, Mr. Nanny, Senseless, and American Pie Presents: The Book of Love.</p><p>Hemsley also had a passion for music and released two albums: Dance (1992), an R&B album; and Ain’t That a Kick in the Head (1989), a single featuring him singing the classic song by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn. He also performed on stage with various musical acts, such as The Temptations and En Vogue.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Death and Legacy</strong></h3><p>Hemsley died on July 24, 2012, at his home in El Paso, Texas. He was 74 years old. According to Ebony, his cause of death was superior vena cava syndrome due to lung cancer. Superior vena cava syndrome is a condition where the superior vena cava, a large vein that carries blood from the upper body to the heart, is compressed or obstructed by a tumor or other mass. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, swelling of the face and neck, coughing, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing.</p><p>Hemsley’s death was met with sadness and shock by his fans and colleagues. Many celebrities paid tribute to him on social media and expressed their admiration for his work and personality. His former co-stars from The Jeffersons also shared their memories of him and praised him for his talent and humor.</p><p>Hemsley’s body was cremated after his death, but his ashes were not buried until November 2012 due to a legal dispute over his will between his longtime friend and business partner Flora Enchinton Bernal and a man named Richard Thornton who claimed to be Hemsley’s half-brother. A judge eventually ruled in favor of Bernal and allowed her to proceed with Hemsley’s funeral arrangements. Hemsley’s ashes were interred at the Fort Bliss National Cemetery in El Paso, Texas, with full military honors.</p><p>Hemsley is remembered as one of the most iconic and influential actors in American television history. His portrayal of George Jefferson broke stereotypes and barriers for black actors and comedians and inspired generations of performers. His comedic timing, his expressive voice, and his charismatic presence made him a legend in the entertainment industry. He left behind a legacy of laughter and joy that will live on forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfqLWmvsyapWaglaLArbHYrGScmaWosm67xWabnpmknXqpu9Zmq6GdXZeyrbvVnptmmZOpvLN5z5qqrJ2UYq64rdho</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stefanie-cohen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stefanie Cohen</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marisa-tomei-does-not-get-nake-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marisa Tomei Does Not Get Naked As Often As You Might Think</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
