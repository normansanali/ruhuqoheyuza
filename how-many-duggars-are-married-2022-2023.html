Though the reality TV shows have ended, fans got used to hearing about (and watching) the Duggar courtships, weddings, and births. Without the show going on, it's harder to see what the Duggars are up to, though not impossible. Each year brings more Duggar babies, marriages, and drama—but who is as yet unmarried?</p><p><strong>Updated January 31st, 2023: </strong>This article has been updated with recent information on the Duggars, including possible courtship for the now-grown kids.</p><h2 id=how-many-of-the-duggar-kids-are-married>How Many Of The Duggar Kids Are Married?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/austin-joy-anna-duggar-forsyth-tlc.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's start by saying that most of the Duggar kids are already married, and many of them were married quite young. There are 19 Duggar children, 20 including Michelle's great-grand-nephew, who she and Jim Bob have custody of, and 11 are married.</p><p>Those include Josh, John-David, Jill, Jessa, Jinger, Joseph, Josiah, Joy-Anna, Jedidiah, Jeremiah, and Justin.</p><p>The first wedding was, of course, oldest sibling Josh's, in 2008; Josh was 20 at the time. Later, Jill married Derick Dillard (in 2014), Jessa married Ben Seewald (in 2014), Jinger married Jeremy Vuolo (in 2016), and Joy-Anna married Austin Forsyth in 2017.</p><p>By that time, it seemed like all the younger, rowdy boys of the Duggar household had magically sprouted into grown men, and were soon walking down the aisle themselves.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Supporters Are Thrilled For Anna Duggar Over This Recent 'Reveal'">Jeremy Vuolo Has No Problem Letting Wife Jinger Be The Family Breadwinner</a></span></p><p>Joseph married Kendra Caldwell in 2017 when he was 22. Josiah married Lauren in 2018, at age 21. John-David, as yet unmarried twin to Jana, was a bit of a late bloomer in Duggar timelines; he married Abbie Burnett in 2018 at age 28.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then in 2021, Justin married Claire Spivey, and the two were 18 and 19, respectively. The same year, 22-year-old Jedidiah married Katelyn Nakatsu; More recently, in March 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah Duggar married Hannah Wissmann</a>; Jeremiah was 23 at the time, and the two had courted for roughly three months.</p><h2 id=which-duggar-kids-still-live-at-home>Which Duggar Kids Still Live At Home?</h2><p>Generally, the Duggar kids get married fairly young, but there is one exception; the oldest Duggar daughter Jana hasn't yet moved out of the family compound or ever courted. While fans have plenty of theories about why that is, the fact remains that Jana is still at home as she heads into her mid-30s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What other siblings haven't yet left the nest due to being underage or, perhaps, not yet interested in marriage? Though the <a href=#>fan-labeled lead "Duggar favorite"</a> is long gone, a handful of kids still fill the Duggar home.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="It Turns Out The Duggars Don't Have A Rule Against This Expression Of Individuality">An Amazon Documentary Might Shed Light On The Duggar Family's Secrets</a></span></p><p>As of January 2023, nine Duggar "kids" (including Jana) still lived at home or at least were not yet betrothed. Those include Jason, James, Jackson, Johannah, Jennifer, Tyler, Jordyn-Grace, and Josie. Of those Duggar children, only five are underage (the girls plus Tyler).</p><p>Which, of course, begs the question; how soon will Jason, James, and Jackson get married and leave home? And will pseudo-Duggar kiddo Tyler Hutchins leave the nest on the same timeline?</p><h2 id=which-duggar-will-get-married-next>Which Duggar Will Get Married Next?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jana-Duggar-in-a-confessional-for-TLC.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As viewers of 19 Kids and Counting know, the Duggars don't date in a conventional sense. Instead, they use very strict courtship rules in finding a suitable spouse for each young adult. In most cases, the kids don't really court until they're 18, or close to it.</p><p>Jason, James, Jackson, and Tyler were the last unmarried Duggar boys as of January 2023. Of them, Tyler is the only one who's underage; Jackson turned 18 in 2022 and could very well begin courting soon.</p><p>Jackson recently got his own social media accounts, says Entertainment Chronicle, which is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">often a turning point for the Duggar kids</a> in terms of when relationships are announced. So far, no word has come from the Duggar camp, though.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Other Members Of The Duggar Family Have Been Up To Since Josh's Arrest">This Is How Much Jim Bob Duggar Is Really Worth</a></span></p><p>But after spotting Jason Duggar out with a mystery girl, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many have assumed he's courting Claire Langdon</a>. To date, the rumors have not been confirmed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for the young women in the household, Jana Duggar remains unmarried at home, and <a href=#>fans have a sad prediction for her future</a> that involves never getting married at all. Her younger sisters, however, may follow a different path.</p><p>Johannah Duggar turns 18 in October 2023; Jennifer turns 16 in August, Jordyn-Grace will be 15, and Josie will be 14. Fans will have to stay tuned to find out what's in store for their futures, and those of the handful of other Duggar kids still living at home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9doq6vxYydrKCfkafAbq3RnmSmmaKntqawjGtna2pdZ31zf44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mickey-rourke-bio-age-net-worth-height.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is USC Star Drake London?
