When the nWo vs. Sting ruled their programming, we had the likes of Tony Schiavone and Bobby Heenan making the great calls. As WCW began to fall, however, a new commentator came in named Mark Madden. His personality made him one of the worst announcers wrestling has ever seen.</p><h2 id=mark-madden-rsquo-s-early-days-in-wcw><strong>Mark Madden’s Early Days In WCW</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/wcw-hotline.jpg><p>In the early 1990s, Mark Madden worked as a writer for Pro Wrestling Torch. The Pittsburgh native achieved a level of fame with the former Atlanta Braves legend, Hank Aaron. As WCW was also located in Atlanta, both being owned by Ted Turner, Madden once let Aaron know about the racist comments WCW President Bill Watts had made about Black and gay people. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hank Aaron spoke out against Bill Watts, and in no time, the head of WCW was out.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Eric Bischoff took over as the President of WCW, he brought in Mark Madden. Madden did a variety of jobs, from working in various roles off camera, writing for the promotion’s magazine, and running the WCW hotline. In the days before the internet, if you wanted WCW wrestling news immediately, you had to get on your phone and listen to Mark Madden and “Mean” Gene Okerlund.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Wrestling Fans Forget About Eric Bischoff</a></span></p><h2 id=mark-madden-took-over-commentary-from-bobby-heenan><strong>Mark Madden Took Over Commentary From Bobby Heenan</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mark-madden-nitro.jpg><p>By 2000, Madden was also a prominent shock jock sports radio host in Pittsburgh. You know the type. Every day they’re on the radio screaming and ranting about how much they hate whichever team and its players. They come across as the most negative and angry people in the world, but many manage to find a big audience by drawing in fans with similar opinions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2000, WCW was in very bad shape. The Monday Night Wars with WWE had long been lost, and the promotion was dying financially and creatively. <a href=#>Long time commentator Bobby “The Brain” Heenan</a> was not in great shape, and with a promotion now run by Vince Russo looking to save money, the decision was made to replace the living legend with Mark Madden, a guy most fans had never heard of. It was a disaster.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Relationship Between Bobby Heenan & Tony Schiavone, Explained</a></span></p><h2 id=mark-madden-rsquo-s-heel-persona-was-unbearable><strong>Mark Madden’s Heel Persona Was Unbearable</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/wcw_mayhem2000_announcers.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shock jocks might work in sports and politics, and while heelish commentators have worked well in wrestling, no one wants to turn into a wrestling show to have an angry person scream at them for two or three hours. That was Madden’s style though. His commentary was so grating, and at many times offensive, that it took away from the action in the ring. Rather than supporting the show, Madden tried to be the show.</p><p>No one liked Mark Madden behind the scenes either it seems. Sid Vicious once screamed at him backstage for comments Madden made. A still very alive Bruno Sammartino threatened to sue him when Madden said Sammartino had to be rolling over in his grave after <a href=#>David Arquette’s infamous WCW Championship win</a>.</p><p>Mark Madden’s undoing in WCW came at the hands of one of wrestling’s nicest and most loved stars, Diamond Dallas Page. On a December 10, 2000 episode of Nitro, Madden referred to Page as “Leatherface,” mocking the future Hall of Famer’s looks. The comments, while awful, aren’t shocking in a world where heel commentators regularly insult wrestlers, but it was the last straw for Madden, who wasn’t seen as a character, but a naturally mean person who meant what he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Best WCW Commentators (& 5 Worst)</a></span></p><h2 id=mark-madden-was-fired-by-wcw><strong>Mark Madden Was Fired By WCW</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/wcw_springstampede2000_ddp.jpg><p>DDP blew up at Madden and the commentator was suspended for a week. DDP, being the nice guy that he is, later tried to apologize to Madden and shake his hand, but Madden refused. He had no problem making fun of everyone, but when they stuck up for themselves and fought back, he couldn’t handle the consequences.</p><p>With it looking like DDP’s close friend Eric Bischoff was going to run WCW again (it never came to be), WCW made the preemptive strike of firing Mark Madden. He would be involved in more controversies on his way out the door, but would thankfully never be a wrestling commentator again. His radio show in Pittsburgh still continues to this day, but the controversies haven’t ended. <a href=#>He had a short-lived podcast with Ric Flair before the Nature Boy fired him.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maybe Mark Madden is a good person behind the scenes. He did speak out against racism afterall at the risk of his career and should be commended for it. He was very close with his mother. And when he contracted COVID, he spoke up in his support for vaccines. While his gimmick might work for radio, however, in WCW, it only helped to turn fans away even more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenmMRuucCromalkZmxprqMppiyZZiWw6Z5wZ6cp2WknbJuw86rqq1lkaO7sMHNnJyrZZmjeri%2BxKyrpaGenHqptdKtpquxXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./memes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Memes - Vulture</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marc-mezvinskys-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marc Mezvinskys net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
