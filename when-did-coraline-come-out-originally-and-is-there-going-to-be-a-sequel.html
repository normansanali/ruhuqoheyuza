The movie was produced by the studio Laika as its very first feature film, and became a runaway success.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>Top actors voiced the movie, including Jennifer Saunders, Dakota Fanning, and Teri Hatcher. It was a massive hit; after its release in February of 2009, Coraline grossed $16.85 million in just its opening weekend.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>In the end, the film made $124 million USD worldwide, ranking it as the third-highest grossing stop-motion movie of all time (after&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicken Run</a>&nbsp;(2000) and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</a>&nbsp;(2005).</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>Beloved by fans and critics, Coraline was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards.</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>Some fans note that the animation resembles the animated work of dark director Tim Burton.</p><h2 id=h-did-tim-burton-make-coraline data-injectable=false><strong>Did Tim Burton make&nbsp;</strong>Coraline?</h2><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>No, Tim Burton did not have anything to do with the film Coraline, despite its style being reminiscent of his work. Coraline was directed by Henry Selick.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>The film’s story follows Caroline, a girl who finds an alternate universe behind a secret door in her new home: a universe that reveals dark and sinister elements, and strange characters like dancing circus mice and ghost children. She also discovers alternate versions of people she’s familiar with, including strange versions of her own parents.</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=164 data-injectable=false>Caroline must be clever and nimble to survive the weird obstacles she faces in the alternate universe and be reunited with her real parents, back in the real world.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>While it’s a children’s movie,&nbsp;Coraline&nbsp;contains dark themes and creepy imagery, like buttons being sewn onto characters’ faces in place of eyes, and the stop-motion adds a jerky and surreal quality to the visuals. It’s a beautifully-crafted film that’s still being rewatched by fans worldwide. So, why hasn’t it been made into a series yet?</p><h2 id=h-is-there-going-to-be-a-coraline-2 data-injectable=false>Is there going to be a Coraline 2?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Coraline.jpg><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>The answer is maybe… but probably not. There are several factors at play. You see, the president and CEO of the production studio Laika, Travis Knight, stated that he does not like reboots or sequels (via&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Collider</a>). That is some bad news for Coraline fans.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>Also, Neil Gaiman has not written a sequel to his original novella, and has claimed that he will only do so if he can come up with an even better story, to top the original (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Screenrant</a>). So, while it’s possible that Gaiman will write about the further adventures of Coraline in the future, it seems that fans will have to wait for him to be sufficiently inspired to write more about the character.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>However, there is some good news: Neil Gaiman has not officially ruled out writing another novella or even full graphic novel as a follow-up to Coraline, so there is hope. Unfortunately for Coraline fans, Neil Gaiman is a very busy man.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>Between his many public appearances, radio plays, books and screenplay adaptations, Gaiman is a sought-after creator who may simply not have the time to write a sequel to Coraline.</p><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=151 data-injectable=false>If he does write a sequel, and a different studio steps up to produce it, then there’s still a chance that fans will be able to see a Coraline 2.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahnKdllJ6xbq%2FOq5iloZ6aeqS7zJ5kqK2kYryztcaipZqknK56orrDZqCsZaSdsrOxjKCmoqaXYsGwecGeZJplo5q%2BtrHLaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-charlotte-ritchie-leave-call-the-midwife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Did Charlotte Ritchie Leave 'Call the Midwife'?
