To nobody’s surprise, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the flick was a massive success</a>, earning $758 million worldwide and subsequently getting the thumbs up for a sequel in just weeks after the first movie’s release.</p><p>What was most interesting, however, was the amount of money Jolie was said to have earned for signing on for the movie — and how much did she make for agreeing to star in a follow-up five years later?

I wanted to have fun and explore different art and performance, in a way I hadn’t done.</p><p>“But most of all, I read Linda’s script and I was really moved by it. I actually got very emotional when I finished it. I thought it was one of the best scripts I’d read, in a long time, because of the issues it dealt with. I thought it was, in fact, an important story to tell.”</p><p>Jolie’s next major motion picture will be Marvel’s upcoming Eternals, which is rumored to earn her the biggest payday of her career, according to multiple reports close to the deal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s still unclear how much Marvel offered the Los Angeles native, but considering how Robert Downey Jr pulled in $75 million from Avengers: Infinity War, it’s fair to assume that an actress as big as Jolie could potentially be earning similar numbers — especially if the movie fares well at the box office.</p><p>Jolie plays Thena, the 4000-year-old daughter of Cybele and Zura who was first generation Eternals, whose character plays a pivotal part in Marvel’s phase 4.</p><p>She’s also taken on the role of Karina in the upcoming drama, Every Note Played, alongside Christoph Waltz, who previously worked with the actress' estranged husband on 2009’s Inglorious B******ds.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Reacts To The Weeknd & Angelina Jolie Seen Together Again In LA Concert</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In March 2021, reports claimed Jolie was ready to provide “proof of domestic abuse” in her ongoing divorce battle against Pitt, whom she parted ways from back in September 2016.</p><p>The pair have been embroiled in a bitter custody battle concerning their six children, with sources saying Jolie has not been fond of the idea of sharing custodial rights with her estranged husband following a supposed countless incidents of alleged abuse that occurred in their family household.</p><p>The usually very private star opened up in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">candid chat with British Vogue in February 2021 about the ordeal,</a> saying, “I don’t know.
