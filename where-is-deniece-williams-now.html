Deniece was 73 years old at the time this article was written.</p><p>United States citizen June Deniece Chandler was born and reared in Gary, Indiana. She enrolled at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, intending to study anaesthesia and become a registered nurse, but she left after one and a half years.</p><p>Williams started performing while still in college, with “a part-time job singing at a club called Casino Royal, and I liked it.” It was a lot of fun.” During that time, she also worked at a phone company and as a ward clerk at Chicago Mercy Hospital.</p><p>Williams recorded for The Toddlin’ Town label group as Deniece Chandler. “I’m Walking Away,” released in the late 1960s on Toddlin’s subsidiary Lock Records, is a popular song in England’s Northern Soul genre. A brief spell with Patti Hamilton’s The Lovelites in 1969 resulted in her singing lead on “I’m Not Like the Others,” a 1999 release.</p><p>According to the BBC, she is “one of the great soul voices.” She is best known for her hits “Free,” “Silly,” and “It’s Gonna Take a Miracle,” as well as her two Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 singles “Let’s Hear It for the Boy” and “Too Much, Too Little, Too Late” (both with Johnny Mathis). Williams has four Grammy nominations and four victories. She is also known for co-writing “Without Us,” the Family Ties theme song, with Johnny Mathis.</p><h2>Where Is Deniece Williams Now?</h2><p>Singer Deniece Williams is still going strong. She has two forthcoming gigs in addition to her current cross-country tour. The YouTube Theater in Inglewood will host Williams’ subsequent tour stop before she performs at the Thunder Valley Casino Resort’s The Venue in Lincoln.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSesrSu1LOxZ5ufonuotI6wn56qlWK2tHnDnqWinZOaeri1y6WgmqWjYruww44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-plays-tsireya-in-avatar-the-way-of-water.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who plays Tsireya in Avatar: The Way of Water?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-laser-dentistry-credihealth-blog.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>WHAT IS LASER DENTISTRY?
