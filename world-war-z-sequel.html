On the big screen, sensations like <strong>Shaun of the Dead</strong>, <a href=#><strong>28 Days Later</strong></a>, <strong>Zombieland</strong>, and the <strong>Resident Evil</strong> franchise are turning hefty profits at the box office, cashing in on the undead phenomenon. Not to be outdone, the executives at Paramount Studios took notice and decided to dip their toe into the cash-soaked waters of the subgenre. They planned to do so with the <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a>-led epic zombie apocalypse film<a href=#> <strong>World War Z</strong></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These execs are not stupid, so they grabbed one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood to appear in a zombie film at the peak of their popularity. Barring <a href=#>any production setbacks</a> or awful writing (not going to happen with <strong>Damon Lindelof</strong> in the writer's room) it was destined to make a ton of money — and they were right. World War Z soared to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a worldwide cash grab of over $530 million</a> on a budget of less than half of that number. So if some is good, then more must be better, right? It was decided that they would make a sequel and see if they could earn a couple of hundred more million bucks for the big bosses at Paramount. But, it never happened, and there are several reasons why.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/world-war-z-international-poster-404x600.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>World War Z</h5>PG-13<p class=display-card-description>Former United Nations employee Gerry Lane traverses the world in a race against time to stop a zombie pandemic that is toppling armies and governments and threatens to destroy humanity itself.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>June 20, 2013</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Marc Forster</a></span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span>Brad Pitt , <a data-id href=#>Mireille Enos</a> , Daniella Kertesz , <a data-id href=#>James Badge Dale</a> , Ludi Boeken , <a data-id href=#>Matthew Fox</a></span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>116</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Action</a></span> <strong>Writers</strong> <span>Matthew Michael Carnahan , Drew Goddard , Damon Lindelof , <a data-id href=#>J.

On paper, it was a match made in heaven as Pitt and Fincher had already teamed up in memorable films like <a href=#><strong>Se7en</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Fight Club</strong></a>, and <strong>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</strong>. Unfortunately, the A-lister Pitt had signed on to do <strong>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</strong> with <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong> and <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong>, and the release was rescheduled to June 2019. Pitt was also under contract to do<strong> Ad Astra</strong>, which would leave no time for the sequel until he had wrapped both films. Unfortunately, by the time 2019 rolled around, Fincher was already doing some great work on the second season of <a href=#>the hit Netflix television show, <strong>Mindhunter</strong>.</a> He and his crew were going to be shooting in Pittsburgh for the foreseeable future, and <a href=#>that caused another delay</a>. Between <strong>the hectic schedules of its star and director</strong>, the film was beginning to look like the deck was stacked against a sequel ever being made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/david-fincher-horror-movies.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="David Fincher, Please Come Back to the Horror Genre!">David Fincher, Please Come Back to the Horror Genre!</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>A true master never loses his touch.</p><h2 id=china-39-s-ban-on-zombie-and-ghost-movies-was-another-major-setback>China's Ban on Zombie and Ghost Movies Was Another Major Setback</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gong-Yoos-character-saving-his-family.jpg><p>When it comes to business outside the United States, China is the most crucial country to tap into if you want to maximize your box office profits. And that was also going to be a problem, as the mercurial politics of the massive country had <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">put a ban on the release</a> of any movies that had anything to do with images of zombies or ghosts</strong>, per the instructions of the rigid Chinese regulations on foreign films entering the country. Because of some shadowy Communist party censorship guidelines that prohibit “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">promoting cults or superstition,”</a> foreign films featuring zombies, vampires, werewolves, mummies, and ghosts have routinely been excluded from Chinese theaters by government censors. On average, only about 35 foreign films a year are even allowed into the country at all. Past casualties of this strict regulation include <a href=#>2016 movies like <strong>Ghostbusters</strong></a> and the <a href=#>South Korean zombie movie <strong>Train to Busan</strong></a> (which still made a bundle as a downloadable offering). It was yet another setback to a sequel that was looking less and less likely to ever get made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paramount-had-concerns-over-39-world-war-z-2-39-s-budget>Paramount Had Concerns Over 'World War Z 2's Budget</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>As if World War Z 2 didn't have enough working against it already, the ever-lurking issue of finances and balancing the books began to emerge. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Per The Playlist</a>, <strong>Paramount was concerned that the film was going to be too expensive to make</strong>. Although it was thought that the film would come in at a price tag of less than the $190 million budget for the first film, with plans to shoot in five different countries, along with a six-week stint in the popular United States filming locations in Georgia, it wasn't low enough for the studio. Fincher would not come off of his number and in February 2019, <a href=#>Paramount executives decided to part ways with the director</a> over the budget dispute. It's safe to assume that Paramount was getting a little nervous about footing a bill at Fincher's amount of close to $200 million, considering that the film would have an "R" rating and be subject to being banned in China over their unusually strict regulations regarding <a href=#>zombie films</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-future-of-39-world-war-z-2-39-remains-unclear>The Future of 'World War Z 2' Remains Unclear</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They haven't completely put a fork in the zombie apocalypse sequel just yet. It's possible that if Paramount can find another director who would be amenable to a significantly smaller shooting budget, the film might still get the green light and eventually make its way to theaters. <strong>Pitt and his camp have purportedly approved the script</strong>, which is a big hurdle to clear. But getting Pitt to agree to work with another director instead of his friend and longtime collaborator Fincher might be the most difficult obstacle to getting the movie done. Though Fincher is known for wanting to have all his ducks in a row heading into a shoot, it appears that he is no longer a candidate to direct, leaving the future status of the project murky at best. We're hoping that something can come to fruition, so we can see just how the human race fights back now that they have found a vaccine that makes them invisible to the rabid flesh-eating hordes. Perhaps the antidote has some sort of unforeseen harmful side effects like in<strong> <a href=#>I Am Legend</a></strong> and Pitt has to come to the rescue of all mankind for a second time. Here's to hoping that down the road, we'll find out — <a href=#>with or without David Fincher</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>World War Z is available to stream on Paramount+ in the U.S.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Watch on Paramount+</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kxLC%2By51ksJmiYsduv8SqrJ6kXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-armani-white-4977783.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>5 Things To Know About Rapper Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ufc-fighter-jake-shields-slammed-for-fat-shaming-aerie-model.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>UFC fighter Jake Shields slammed for fat-shaming Aerie model</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
