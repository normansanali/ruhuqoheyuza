But lately, she loves to go around more as Ru’s girl since being a part of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK Season 4.</p><p style=text-align:left>Over the course of doing drag for 14 years and good drag for six years, Jonbers waited many summers and winters to be on Drag Race. This season, her prayers were finally heard as she got to be one of the contestants in RuPaul’s Drag Race which premiered on 22 September 2022.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Jonbers Blonde On RuPaul’s Drag Race UK Season 4</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>In her “Meet the Queens” video Jonbers Blonde states that she has worked with the likes of Melanie C, Sam Smith, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Nadine Coyle, and Years & Years. And coincidentally, Olly Alexander of Years & Years is a guest judge on UK Season 4. So, that maybe in a way saved her from the first queen elimination.</p><p style=text-align:left>Plus, it was her game plan that kept her on the show. When asked about her game plan, she said she was going to treat each runway as RuPaul’s Met Ball, Each week and that she would plan to go big and wild.</p><p style=text-align:left>Jonbers, as a drag, is very inspired by the 70s and by fashion runways of all eras.</p><p style=text-align:left>Speaking of her key strengths coming into the competition, she has got the back catalog, she can dance and move, and plus there are her fashion skills. Her not being afraid to be silly, that unique voice also always helped her when she is up on stage.</p><p style=text-align:left>Apparently, Jonbers is one of the only Drag queens ever to perform on the Pyramid Stage of Glastonbury. Jonbers’s BIO on her website also goes on to describe her as the “elusive chantuese” of East London Drag; as a Northern Irish queen who from cattle run to catwalk trampled into the London scene over 10 years ago.</p><p><strong>Fun Fact: </strong>Jonbers has already DJ’ed at a wake and he said he would also not mind going to a funeral in drag.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Jonbers Blonde Out Of Drag</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Out of drag, Jonbers is no more drag queen Jonbers Blonde. She instead looks this way without the “high fashion pig” makeover.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/who-is-jonbers-blonde-her-age-out-of-drag-real-name-2022-300x259.jpg><p style=text-align:left>So, out of drag, Jonbers is this good-looking guy in a male form. Even without the makeover, Starlet’s out-of-drag form seems to have it in him to be a good performer.</p><p style=text-align:left>So you know, Jonbers’s pronoun out of drag is He/Him, and when in drag is She/Her.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>What Is Jonbers Blonde Real Name?</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Drag queen Jonbers Blonde’s real name is Andrew Glover.</p><p style=text-align:left>As for how she got her drag name, she told us this story. One night, she was at her friend’s house dressed to the nines, and when she came down the stairs her friend’s dad looked up from his paper and said, “Jonbers, looking like that you’re going to get very lucky!”. It was since then, she said, ‘Jonbers’ just stuck with her. But then, Jonbers also goes around as drag queen Jonbenet Blonde.</p><p><strong>Did You Know</strong>: If she found £20 on the floor at work, Jonbers would either give it to a homeless person or buy herself a drink or put it towards a new wig.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Jonbers Blonde Age</strong></h3><p>Born in 1989, Jonbers Blonde turned 33 years old in 2022.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Jonbers Blonde On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Jonbers Blonde could be found on Instagram as ‘Call me Jonbers’ (<a href=#>@jonbersblonde</a>) with 246 posts and 15.8K followers as of 25 September 2022.</p><p>She also actively shared glimpses from mostly her drag life on <a href=#>Facebook</a>, Twitter (@jonbersblonde), TikTok (@jonbersblonde), as well as on <a href=#>Cameo</a>.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Jonbers Blonde Partner</strong></h3><p>Drag Queen Jonbers Blonde’s relationship status was unconfirmed as of 2022. So, if she had a partner, no one knew of it.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Jonbers Blonde Job</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>While Drag performers and alternative cabaret acts had their livelihood sucker punched twice by the COVID pandemic, Jonbers was one of the few who actually blossomed under Covid.</p><p style=text-align:left>Since then, the self-employed freelancer has gone on to perform more shows at The Glory, Bistrotheque, and The Bethnal Green Workers Club. And by December 2020, he was working on his new show. It was a queer murder mystery with a “bit more Jackie Collins” to it; funded by the Arts Council.</p><p style=text-align:left>When not performing with the likes of Little Mix and Melanie C, Jonbers also&nbsp;is the events director at queer collective Sink the Pink, and parent event company East Creative.
