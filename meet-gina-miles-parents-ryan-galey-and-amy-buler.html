She has her coach Niall Horan to thank for this, but most of all, she’s grateful to her parents; especially her father who helped her kick start her career in music.</span></p><p><span>But who are Gina Miles’ parents? Keep reading to find out.</span></p><h3><b>The Voice: Who Are Gina Miles Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Gina Miles loves her parents, Ryan Galey and Amy Buler to the moon. However, Amy isn’t her biological mother. Her father raised her all on his own. No wonder, she seems to like him more.</span></p><p><span>But this doesn’t mean Amy doesn’t love her. Infact, it was Gina’s stepmother who supported her when she wanted to pursue music more seriously and decided to move in with her aunt in Sacramento. The transition to a big city was very intimidating at first, but now, she’s a top 5 finalist on The Voice.</span></p><p><span>For the top-5 round, Gina chose Taylor Swift’s “Style,” which Niall called “ridiculous” and praised her for going with a pop song after all of the “haunting” songs she’s taken on before. She then closed out the evening with Sinead O’Connor’s “Nothing Compares 2 U.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“That was a special moment on ‘The Voice’ for me.” Niall shared. “She needs to win this thing.”</span></p><h3><b>Meet Ryan Galey, Gina Miles Father</b></h3><p><span>Ryan Galey is Gina Miles’ loving father. He raised her as a single dad, DJ’ing every weekend.</span></p><p><span>After Gina turned 14, it was also he who helped her get more into the music scene and invited her to his gigs. Naturally, he’s the proudest of his daughter, and now even more, for she’s made it to the Top 5 in </span><i><span>The Voice</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>“BOOM!
