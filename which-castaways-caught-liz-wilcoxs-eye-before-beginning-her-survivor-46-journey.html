He’s got two earrings and a little bit of a Jerry Seinfeld mullet. He is rocking it better than me, honestly, and I can’t get a read on him, but he just seems really focused, and going back to what I said about having an ally who is concentrated and doesn’t self-sabotage, I feel like that guy might be it.
