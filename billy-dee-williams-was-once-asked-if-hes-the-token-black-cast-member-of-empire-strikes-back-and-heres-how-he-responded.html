So, one interviewer decided to ask Williams, point blank, what he thought.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>Williams landed the role fairly easily, because Irvin Kershner wanted him for it, and Williams obviously knew how big Empire was going to be. Kershner even told Williams that the role of Lando Calrissian was actually completely written with him in mind.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Williams loved the character’s name</a>, partially because he believed it wasn’t a Black name for a Black actor and insisted that the actors in Bespin — the small city that Lando oversees — were a diverse group of people.</p><p data-characters=539 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>Quickly accepting the role while expressing admiration for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">George Lucas</a>, Williams became an integral part of the main cast of the original trilogy. Once the film was released in May of 1980, Williams did a series of interviews on his own, including a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bizarre interview on the Today Show</a>, and a handful of print interviews that appeared in newspapers across the country. In addition, Williams did interviews with the other cast members, including one with Carrie Fisher where the duo sat down with prolific celebrity interview Bobby Wygant.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>Just as they were about to start the interview, Williams complimented Wygant’s bracelet and even smoothly noted how nice it was to see her again. Wygant, after giving a brief “thank you,” goes right into her very first question.</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>She asked Williams, “Billy, do you think that there are going to be some people who are going to say, ‘Oh, well, there he is the token Black now,’ and what do you have to say to those people?”</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>To Wygant’s defense, there were some people saying such things, but it certainly wasn’t a significant percentage of Star Wars fans. Williams, quite possibly wondering why she would start the interview with such a question, didn’t hesitate at all in his response.</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>“Well,” Williams answered, “I don’t think about things like that, really. I just want to have a lot of fun, and this is part of it, and I was very pleased to be invited as a part of the Star Wars cast.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=87 data-injectable=false>Williams later disarms Wygant with his charm by complimenting her teeth and her smile.</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>Maybe the best part of the interview is how humble the smooth-talking Williams is. It’s intriguing to see the most confident actor of the bunch, who plays the most confident character in the film, be so modest.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>He genuinely seems to love the film, and praises the production. Early on in the interview, he mentions how such a film is real departure for him, as would would his role in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the grossly underrated Sylvester Stallone film Nighthawks</a>, and compliments his co-actors by saying, “Everybody else in it is incredible besides me.”</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>We all know how incredible Billy Dee Williams was in the role but his humility is admirable. If we don’t have Lando, or more accurately Billy Dee as Lando, than Empire doesn’t work the way it so perfectly does.</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>Let’s not forgot that Wedge Antilles and Lando Calrissian are the ones that blow up the second Death Star and save everyone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomaKknK56pbHEZq6ipJyerq6%2FjLCYrGWfo7CmecCsop6cXZ6zbrTErGStoJViwbC3xKdkm6SRmLhur8Csq2allaKvpr6MqJ1mnZ2ltrOxjKyrq6GbmsBursCcomaZnpl6qbHRnqpmoJ%2BseqmxjKucrKifo7GmsI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./karla-mosley-returning-maya.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bold &amp;amp; Beautiful's Karla Mosley (Maya) on Returning to Daytime</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./big-ang-remembered-her-5-best-mob-wives-moments-w164764.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Big Ang Remembered: Her 5 Best 'Mob Wives' Moments</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alessandra-ambrosio.html>Alessandra Ambrosio News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bachelorette-star-kaitlyn-bristowe-addresses-claims-copying-exs-girlfriend.html>Bachelorette Star Kaitlyn Bristowe Addresses Claims Shes Copying Exs New Girlfriend</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jeff-smith-car-accident-norwalk-ct-former-norwalk-high-school-band-director-death-learn-more.html>Jeff Smith Car Accident, Norwalk CT Former Norwalk High School Band Director Death, Learn More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-275045.html>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marcia-aoki-parents-meet-isaura-aoki-paulo-aoki.html>Marcia Aoki Parents: Meet Isaura Aoki &amp;amp; Paulo Aoki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
